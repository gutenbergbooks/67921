  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER I.<br /> <span class='large'>A DECLARATION OF WAR.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>It was thousands of years before the Christian era—how
many thousands no chronicler has stated. And
the island lay, as through the ages past, fair and imperial
in the Atlantic. Though now was it becoming wanton,
even to its undoing. Else would not this be written.</p>

<p class='c011'>Midsummer was upon this Atlantis, upon the islands
attendant that served as stepping-stones to the continents
beyond. Under the soft sensuousness, the morn was taking
richer glow, the streams brightening to gold, the
gardens and vineyards glorifying in green; whilst hill
and mountain grew alluring in shadow and color, the
palaces lustrous in their tri-tinted stones, and the temples’
syenite a gleaming red that rivaled the flashing
orichalcum studding domes and pinnacles. The great
island was a gorgeous mosaic: and its setting, sapphire,
that royal stone emblematic of calm and truth; for the
laving waters were as serene as blue, in such being all
suggestive of that repose which comes of perception of
the true. The whole was a glory.</p>

<p class='c011'>About Cleit, that royal city gracing the stream Luith,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>in the southeastern part of the island, there was an
unusual stir. This day was to be observed one of the
most ancient, and therefore simplest, of the customs of
Atlantis. The king and royal rulers were to give
audience to the principal captains of the nation, and
receive the certificates of their prowess for the year.
And now, from Cleit’s harbor, which was a few miles
southward of the city, at the mouth of Luith, were speeding
the galleys of Cleit’s captains; whilst from points
north, east, south, and west, the many other captains
were hastening, that all might meet in the grounds of
the royal palace before noon of this auspicious day.</p>

<p class='c011'>Upon the great marble landing place, these captains
came together, about them thronging the people in gayest
holiday attire. Most evident was it that the latter
still took pleasure in this old-fashioned observance, that
they wished not to fall behind in its celebration, notwithstanding
the times were changing so wofully. Many
had been the prognostications of the few conservatives
remaining that erelong this simple, this most ancient
custom, would come to naught. Indeed, most of these
had averred privately that the meeting of the year before
would prove the last.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet here were again convening these mighty captains—size
being a consideration of their office. Here, again,
were they towering above the average Atlantean, tall as
he was. Fine was it to note their flashing eyes, their
grand bearing, as they imparted such information as they
were free to give to the curious, fast-questioning ones;
but finer to witness the expanding eyes of the latter as
their ears took in the wonder, the verity of it all!</p>

<p class='c011'>But the great silver gong was sounding. It was noon.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>Then men, women, and children burst into acclamations.
Already were the captains forming into line, with the
captain general at the head. Again sounded the gong.
Therewith, the line filed along the marble pathway to
the palace, followed by the cheering throng.</p>

<p class='c011'>But gradually the throng quieted. Ever was the palace
neared reverently. There was a hush, when, from
out the thick foliage, it arose upon them lustrous in its
stones of red, white, and black, its facings of alabaster,
its columns of marble and orichalcum, its red pinnacles;—a
palace well befitting this land of glamour.</p>

<p class='c011'>Like all the other palaces of the island, this was simple
of construction. The main plan consisted of rectangles
set about a great court, these rectangles being two-storied.
In the lower story, light was admitted through
large apertures protected by curtains and shutters of
hard wood set in at will. Additional light was also
admitted from the upper story, which was supported
by columns and open at the sides, curtains excluding the
sunshine at pleasure. Some of these columns extended
from the lower floor to the roof; others rested on the
walls of the lower story, where the thickness would permit;
and each was many volumes in its inscriptions and
sculptures.</p>

<p class='c011'>The captains mounted the grand portico with its columns
of marble and orichalcum, each innumerable volumes;
passed through the narrowing portal, guarded by
its colossal winged bulls, to the great hall; and thence to
the state chamber—on the right, still followed by the
throng.</p>

<p class='c011'>Great and glittering was this oblong state chamber.
Its high, arched ceiling of ivory and bronze was rich in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>gilding. The walls were paneled in ivory overlaid with
silver, many of the panels being inscribed with the laws
of Poseidon and Atlas. The pavement was of blue and
white marbles. To this fell from the apertures hangings
of finest yellow linen. The seats were of carved ebony;
and at the farther end were the golden throne, and the
ivory chairs of the rulers, priests, and nobles.</p>

<p class='c011'>With arms folded on their breasts and heads bent low,
the captains advanced until they stood a goodly row
before their king. He, of name Atlano, sat high on a dais
raised above another dais; and about him were ranged
the royal rulers. On the lower dais sat the priests and
nobles, the priests being to the right.</p>

<p class='c011'>When the apartment could hold no more, the gong
sounded. Thereupon the chamberlain, who stood out
upon the lower dais, made the sign; and low bent these
that had just entered before their king, until the chamberlain
said, “Ye will arise.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The king then waved his scepter. As one, the priests
and nobles stood to intone a welcome to the captains.
Afterward, arose the royal rulers to smile and bow in
greeting.</p>

<p class='c011'>The white raiment and silver circlets of the priests
were in strong contrast to the gorgeous robing and jeweled
headgear of the rulers and nobles. But the king
was dazzling in his royal purple robe, his scintillating
crown, and the wondrous mantle sacred to himself.
This last was ingeniously fashioned of finest, rarest
feathers, varying in color from cream to orange, and was
of such length as to sweep the floor behind. Though well
he bore this aggregation of rich hues. For Atlano was
handsome in the best Atlantean type, though his expression was harsh, cruel. But he was softening somewhat
at sight of these brave captains standing in such humility
before him. And, smiling, he addressed them.</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>“Captains, thy king giveth greeting.”</p>

<p class='c011'>They responded, “O most gracious of kings, Atlano,
long may thy great self thus beam upon thy captains!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Atlano inclined his head. The rulers, priests, and
nobles intoned:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Long, O most gracious king, Atlano, may thy captains
thus come before thee!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Long live the king!” returned the captains.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then followed an invocation to the gods by the aged
high priest Olto, his son, the chief priest Oltis, assisting.
Thereafter, the rulers, priests, and nobles sat down, and
the king addressed the chamberlain.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Shafo, if it seemeth good, the captains may now tell
us of their work.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The chamberlain pointed with his wand: “Captain
General, thou wilt begin.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The captain general stepped out from his fellows, and,
in measured tones, replied as if to the king:</p>

<p class='c011'>“O most gracious of kings, Atlano, this I state to
thy great self: I, captain of the war vessel <i>Atlas</i>, since
leaving the harbor of Cleit, eleven moons since, have
sailed around the country of the Afrites, and up its eastern
coast. At many places, we fell upon the black people,
and took of their gold and ivory; and then sent them
into the inner parts to get incense trees, nutwoods, ebony,
apes with dog heads,<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c012'><sup>[1]</sup></a> monkeys with long tails, and
greyhounds. It is two weeks since we came into harbor,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>and yielded our cargo. This showeth its worth, and
stateth the sums we of the vessel merit.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bowing low, the captain general handed a roll of papyrus
to an attendant, who laid it upon a table below the
dais.</p>

<p class='c011'>The chamberlain then pointed his wand toward the
captain first in line. He stepped forward, and spoke in
uncertain tones that slowly strengthened:</p>

<p class='c011'>“O most gracious of kings, Atlano, this I state to thy
great self: I, captain of the trading vessel <i>Mestor</i>, came
into Chimo thirty days since from our people of Chimu,<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c012'><sup>[2]</sup></a>
whither I sailed twelve moons ago, bearing a cargo of
dried fruits, grains, and rare woods. There I found our
people building a temple to the great Amen, that in
shape is like unto a pyramid, and in size is half a mile
around. Already are the temples, palaces, and tombs of
Chimu looking as ours. And great is the decking in
gold and silver, for the mines are not far. Of gold, silver,
and gems I bring to Chimo large stores. This
showeth the worth of the cargo, and the sums which we
of the vessel merit.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The captain handed his roll to the captain general, who,
in turn, handed it to the attendant. When this captain
had resumed his place, the next captain, at beck of the
chamberlain, stepped out to continue:</p>

<p class='c011'>“O most gracious of kings, Atlano, this I state to thy
great self: I, captain of the war vessel <i>Azaes</i>, left Autochthin
seven moons since to bear to the fair green island<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c012'><sup>[3]</sup></a>
in the north a band of our people, and with them left the
means of living for the time of twelve moons. On my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>way from there I ran in the passage to the Middle Sea<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c012'><sup>[4]</sup></a>
to look about a little, but at once sped back upon seeing
some large vessels, strange and threatening. It is twenty
days since I came into Autochthin. I bring to thee, O
most gracious King, this written word of the planting of
our people in the island, of their further needs, and of the
sums that we of the vessel merit.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And the captain handed in his roll.</p>

<p class='c011'>At mention of these unknown vessels, the king’s
scarcely-concealed indifference vanished. He looked
surprised, then alarmed. With increasing emotion, he
glanced from rulers to nobles to find their wearied expressions
had, at least, become interested.</p>

<p class='c011'>But on went the harangues. One captain had sailed
beyond the western seas, and northward up a mighty
river to the colony Missos.<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c012'><sup>[5]</sup></a> Another had sailed
around the country of the Afrites, and eastward to that
sultry land that supplied them with gems. Another had
been to the land of the Eskaldi.<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c012'><sup>[6]</sup></a> Thus ran the reports
until it was the turn of the last captain but one. He
stepped out with an air important; and, in more important
tone, began:</p>

<p class='c011'>“O most gracious of kings, Atlano, to thy great self I
would state that I am captain of the vessel <i>Paero</i>. It is
eleven moons since I left for Khemi,<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c012'><sup>[7]</sup></a> with a cargo of
rare woods, grains, and wool. I bring from Khemi green
stone, red granite of Syene, and the byssus of the Middle
Sea. Yesterday came I back to Cleit; and therefore
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>have I not my roll. But within a day will it be ready.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But this captain, instead of returning to his place,
stood waiting.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What wilt thou, Sir Captain?” asked the chamberlain.</p>

<p class='c011'>“O most gracious of kings, Atlano, to thy great self I
would state more.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Most eager became the expressions of king and nobles.
The captain paused until the chamberlain signed for him
to continue.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Most gracious king, a people across the Middle Sea,
to the north of Khemi, causeth fear in the lands about it
because of its quick rise to power. It is not long since
this people passed over from the far east, and now it ruleth
the sea. It is magic.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The king’s red skin deepened to purple. In a voice
grown hoarse, he exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c011'>“The name of this people!”</p>

<p class='c011'>And the chamberlain iterated, “The name of this people!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“O most gracious king, Atlano, their land is Pelasgia.
They are called Pelasgians. Their king is Pelasgus.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They have a king, then?”</p>

<p class='c011'>This the chamberlain also iterated, as he did the
ensuing questions.</p>

<p class='c011'>“O most gracious king, Atlano, they have a king.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Know they how to war?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“O most gracious King, they are fond of peace; and
think but of trade and tilling the ground.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“More! More!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“O most gracious King, I know no more.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Let him to his place. Cause some other captain to
tell me more!”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>The captain who had put back from the Middle Sea
stepped out, getting the start of the only captain yet to
be heard from. But the latter was willing to bide his
time. At beck of the chamberlain, the former declared:</p>

<p class='c011'>“O most gracious of kings, Atlano, then was it the
vessels of this people that so troubled us. Nothing like
them have I seen for size and strength.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The king turned to left, to right, demanding fiercely,
“Hear ye this? Hear ye this?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Senil, the most venerable of the rulers, arose.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Senil, what wilt thou?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“King Atlano, we hear; and it seemeth evil.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is the thing we shall do?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“O most gracious King, that will we do which seemeth
good to thee.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The king’s face testified to his emotions. His anger
had given way to wild triumph. He ejaculated:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Senil, Rulers, Nobles, we will bring them to naught!
It shall not be said that any power holdeth the sea with
Atlantis!”</p>

<p class='c011'>He turned to regard the captain, who had not as yet
resumed his place; and muttered:</p>

<p class='c011'>“If this be true—if this be true.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was then heard a meaning cough from the last
captain, who had been so forgotten. The king noted this,
and said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Shafo, there is one captain who hath not been heard.”</p>

<p class='c011'>At the sign, this captain stepped forth with an air even
more important than had been that of the captain of the
<i>Paero</i>, and the captain who had withdrawn from the Middle
Sea bowed back to his place. Of due weight were this
captain’s tones.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>“O most gracious of kings, Atlano, to thy great self I
would state that I, the captain of the trading vessel <i>Osir</i>,
came back but yesterday to Elasippa from our land of
Shaphana,<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c012'><sup>[8]</sup></a> after bringing there grain, cotton, and linen,
and taking in corn, wine, and oil. There I heard much
of this new power, for, of late, its vessels come within the
harbor of Shaphana. Thus far this Pelasgia thinketh
not of war, but of trade. Her vessels are marvels of
strength and speed.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hear ye this?” interrupted Atlano, turning to rulers
and nobles, “Her vessels are marvels of strength
and speed!” Then, of the captain, he demanded:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou sayest not that thou didst see aught of these?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The chamberlain iterated this.</p>

<p class='c011'>“O most gracious of kings, I have to say that I saw
them. Two were speeding into harbor as we left it. Nowhere
have I seen vessels that come nigh them!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The king arose and stared at this captain, until he
perforce stammered:</p>

<p class='c011'>“O most gracious king, I have not my roll; but in
two days will it be ready.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But not of him, nor of his certificate, was the king
thinking. His thought was for this new, menacing
power. After some minutes’ absorption, his tones rang
fierce:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is there more?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The chamberlain iterated, “Is there more?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“O most gracious of kings, there is no more.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The captain was waved back to his place. The king,
standing most erect, addressed all.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Rulers, Priests, Nobles, Captains, Leaders, People,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>let us look to this. Let it be the one mind to fall upon
and crush this Pelasgia! What will ye?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Senil arose.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Senil, what wilt thou?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“King Atlano, we will as thou.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The other rulers arose.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Rulers, what will ye?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“King Atlano, we will as thou.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Phiro, a noble young and ardent, here arose.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Phiro, what sayest thou?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Gracious King, if it pleaseth thee, let those who are
for war bend the knee.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is well. Rulers, Priests, Nobles, Captains, Leaders,
People,—ye that are for war bend the knee, and let
us beseech the gods.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Great was the stir in the vast assemblage. Then every
soul bent the knee, even to the king, while the feeble
tones of the high priest began to be heard, asking for
blessing on this so suddenly conceived undertaking.
When he had finished, the king arose, the others still
remaining on their knees, until he said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ye may arise.”</p>

<p class='c011'>When all were standing, and the hush was deepening,
the king exulted:</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is one voice. Here let us make the vow to sweep
from the earth this new power—these marvels of vessels.
Swear!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Every right arm was pointed heavenward, every voice
said solemnly, “We swear!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“So be it. Now will we to work. The Leaders!”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a mighty stir. This indeed meant war.</p>

<p class='c011'>The chamberlain beckoned; and the leaders, who were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>next in rank to the captains, stepped from their places
against the walls on right and left. Tall and stalwart were
they, and attired much like the captains. They wore
not the ordinary loose-flowing robes, but close-fitting
tunics, short, loose lower garments similar to the trousers
of to-day, and high boots of soft skins. On their
heads were helmet-shaped caps of red linen; and about
their waists were broad bronze belts, inscribed with their
office and number.</p>

<p class='c011'>These leaders formed a considerable body in the kingdom,
each province having its quota. Their office was
this: When war was declared, each was to furnish one-sixth
of the portion of a war chariot with its two horses
and riders; also, a light chariot with a fighting man on
foot and charioteer; also, two heavy-armed men, two
archers, two slingers, three stone shooters, three javelin
men, and four sailors.<a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c012'><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Of course these leaders present belonged to Cleit; but
it was understood that whatever the king commanded
them, the nine rulers would command their own.</p>

<p class='c011'>To these leaders the king spoke impressively.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Leaders, ye know your duty. This day begin measures
for most bitter war.”</p>

<p class='c011'>On their knees sank the leaders, and there remained
until ordered by the chamberlain to arise. Then their
spokesman answered:</p>

<p class='c011'>“O most gracious of kings, Atlano, thy leaders, as thou
hast said, know well their duty. They will to it this
day.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then, with faces to the king, they moved to their
places.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>The king addressed the rulers.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ye, kin rulers, will speed on the morrow to your
cities, and then give orders to your leaders. Ere the
coming moon is old, gather your vessels within this harbor.
Then on to lay Pelasgia low!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The assemblage, as one, echoed:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yea—on—to lay Pelasgia low!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The exultant king continued:</p>

<p class='c011'>“This further will I say: Daily, at the noon hour, let
every noble come to this state chamber, that plans may
be made, and given out. Let every captain make well
ready his vessel for the men, food, and weapons of war.
Let the people be of one mind through it all.”</p>

<p class='c011'>A murmur of acclamation arose and swelled, the smiling
king permitting it, until it became a mighty shout.
This the people without heard, and answered—forgetting
reverence—until the hangings of the palace moved. And
still the king stood smiling.</p>

<p class='c011'>When there was quiet, he said, with warmth: “Thus
endeth this gathering of the captains. Brave captains,
well have ye done. Thy king knoweth pride beyond
measure. The gods be with you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The captains, after bowing to the floor, stood proudly
erect. The high priest gave the blessing. Afterward,
when the king, with his rulers, nobles, and priests, had
sat down, the chamberlain waved his wand. Slowly
the assemblage went out, with faces ever to the king.
Deeply they saluted him at the threshold, before disappearing.
Of these the captains were the last to withdraw,
as they had been the first to enter. Exultant, with
the king, all passed out to the perfect day, to spread wide
this unlooked-for result of the convention.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>Yet still continued the day in its soft, serene loveliness.</p>

<p class='c011'>The king, rulers, and nobles remained to confer.
But this conference was interrupted somewhat when the
waiting islanders without received word of this declaration
of war. Again, forgetting reverence, they became jubilant.
So much did these Atlanteans love conquest. Those
within the state chamber were but stimulated, doing
quick, vigorous work.</p>

<p class='c011'>One most important measure of this conference was
the unanimous agreement that the queen should reign
during the king’s absence. The nine rulers (descendants
of the nine younger brothers of Atlas, eldest son of
Poseidon) were to remain at home in order to sustain
her, and be subject in a body to her call. Further,
though this was spoken only inwardly, they could the
better watch each other. As each made solemn vow to
be loyal to country and queen, Atlano, of his mocking
spirit, laughed within.</p>

<p class='c011'>For, how could they do otherwise? Would not he
bear with him, his ablest nobles, his chiefs, his captains,
his warmen, his sailors? And would they not return
laden with spoils, strengthened, rioting of victory? What
could stand against them? Well might these rulers
vow to be loyal!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER II.<br /> <span class='large'>QUEEN ATLANA.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>From the state chamber the king sped buoyantly
through the great hall, with its lines of bowing officers and
attendants, each as smiling as himself over this war prospect;
and thence, to the right, along the corridor, to the
queen’s bower room.</p>

<p class='c011'>Most eloquently did this large apartment testify to the
industry of the queen and her ladies, as theirs were the
embroidery upon the hangings of byssus and the coverings
of the couches, the plaiting of the great mats upon
the inlaid floor, the festooning of the flowers from the
satinwood walls. The room was a veritable bower in its
brightness, fragrance, and floral adornments; and, as the
climax to its charms, three of its sides opened upon the
fairy-like, private garden, which spread to the eastward.</p>

<p class='c011'>The queen’s ladies were throwing over a couch the
covering they had just finished as the king entered. After
low salutations, they withdrew. The queen, meanwhile,
had arisen for greeting; and, sad as it may seem, was
wondering at her husband’s cheerfulness of mien.</p>

<p class='c011'>Queen Atlana was tall, gracious, lovely. She was
Atlano’s cousin, being the daughter of his father’s brother
by a princess of Khemi. Owing to her Semitic blood,
hers was not the complexion of the true Atlanteans. In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>her, the mixture of the red and yellow had produced a
richness of skin whose tints were of the olive and the
peach. Her eyes were brown, large, soft, and lustrous;
her hair, black and waving, and worn in high braids about
her head. Her features were straight, the forehead receding
but little, and the mouth beautiful and tender.</p>

<p class='c011'>Her robe was of fine white linen, embroidered in buff;
and hung from her shoulders in folds to the floor, being
confined at the waist by a golden girdle. Her perfect
arms were bare and without ornament. With a grace
bewitching, she moved toward the king, her face flushing
sweetly, and said low in love:</p>

<p class='c011'>“With joy I greet thee, Atlano.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He took her extended hand and led her to her couch,
responding, as he sat down beside her, “With the like
feeling do I greet thee, Atlana.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Her eyes lighted gladly. Such crumbs had begun to
fall rarely from the king’s table, and, therefore, had now
the fullness of the banqueting board. Smiling, she said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou art happy, Atlano. Comest thou from the
meeting of the captains?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The captains left an hour hence. Since then we have
had thought for matters of weight.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a strange exultation about him. She looked
at him in inquiry.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou askest not of the meeting.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was in my thought. Tell me of it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There were the like olden speeches of cargoes taken
out and cargoes brought back, of the planting of our
people in new lands, and their doings; of spoils taken.
Pfui! how sick am I of it! How great is my wish to put
some other in my place to hearken to it all!”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>“But the people would not have it. It hath ever been
the custom of the kings.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A custom of the fools! How weary I grow of it!
This day I was almost in sleep. But one thing I heard
that roused me!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What heardst thou?”</p>

<p class='c011'>He was rubbing his hands gloatingly, his long, thin,
cruel hands.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What thinkest thou, Atlana?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think not. Tell me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He waited, delighting to prolong her impatience; and
then drawled:</p>

<p class='c011'>“We have heard—that—will force—us—to—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“To what?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“To war.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She looked so incredulous that he laughed. “I say
the truth, Atlana. We are to war.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“To war!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Her face had blanched, yet she could not believe.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yea, Atlana, to war. A new power showeth itself to
the north of Khemi. It aimeth to hold the Middle Sea.
We go to crush it!”</p>

<p class='c011'>She grew faint at his relentless tone. However, she
managed to plead:</p>

<p class='c011'>“It cannot harm us. Spare it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Spare it! Much would it spare us should it grow
stronger. Even now is it mighty enough to thrust us to
one side. Do us harm! That is my fear.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Atlano, I beseech that thou wilt seek no quarrel with
this people.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There is no need to seek. I will make one. I will
show them that Atlantis still hath being—that she is not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>dead of her power, her wealth, her spoils, her glory.
Spoils! Here will be another—a grand one! Here will
another land mourn its being—those marvels of vessels
sink beneath the waters, or, better, swell the numbers
of our own. Here will Atlantis show another line to
that dreaming Khemi that doth not rouse even when the
smallest haven goeth beyond her in treading the sea.
What are her piles of stone to one strong, free breath of
the sea? And what a glory to hold every breath as we
have until now! Base Khemi—to be thus given over to
her sands, her works of stone!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Atlano, call to mind that I am fond of Khemi. It is
the land of my mother.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“One would know it when thou wouldst bid me spare
this Pelasgia.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou art wrong to trouble this people.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Such is what I might look for from thee. Ever art
thou against me!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“When have I ever been against thee?”</p>

<p class='c011'>He tried hard to recall an instance, but could not.
Less angry, he insisted:</p>

<p class='c011'>“As a wife, thou hast the right to think with me—hast
the right to bid me good speed when I go to crush
this people.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou! Thou wilt not go?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I go to crush them. The gods have my vow. Here
have I rusted too long. I am as king of Khemi!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou wilt be killed! Atlano, thou wilt be killed!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then wilt thou be queen,” he returned derisively.
“Thou art next in line with all thy Khemian blood, and
these Atlanteans love thee. Ill would they take it should
Oltis come after me—for his father counteth not. That
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>smooth Oltis—well doth he wish it! But I shall not be
killed, if but to bring to naught the hopes of that cunning
priest. He thinketh I see not through him.” Loud
rang his mocking laugh.</p>

<p class='c011'>The queen arose, and, standing before him, besought:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Atlano, for the sake of our land and people, war not.
Think of our Atlanteans who will not come back—of
their darkened homes. Call to mind how, in the time
of thy father, we lost our people in warring against
Fun-hi. And what evil came of it, for it brought on
the death of thy father!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yea, but it made the way for me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Atlano!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Say on, ‘Atlano!’ Well should I sicken of my name!”
(He had arisen to face her vindictively.) “I say to thee,
Atlana, we are to war, war. And now I have done with
it—and thee.” (He turned to go.)</p>

<p class='c011'>“So be it—war! But I warn thee, it is one thing to
war, another to win.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Put not upon it an evil eye, Atlana. If thou dost
croak, I fear.” (He was again facing her.)</p>

<p class='c011'>“I croak not, but I warn thee. The cause is not just.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou art in evil temper this day. It is best that I go
to the temple and talk with Oltis. Ah, thou dost shake!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why art thou ever with Oltis if thou trustest him
not?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I like to draw him on, to make him believe I think
with him, to make him take my way in the end. I like
to see him, the proud one, bend—bend—because I am
the king. He is a toad.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But thou goest to this toad from me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yea, but wert thou more as he I would stay with
thee.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>“Think. Thou didst call him a toad.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I mean, wert thou not so bent of mind. Oltis never
sayeth nay to me. It would be better, Atlana, couldst
thou ever think with me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is but this time, Atlano. Come, sit with me
again. I will be more calm.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nay, I go.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Go not to Oltis.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I like the mirth of it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I fear him. He will do thee evil.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was another mocking laugh. “If thou didst
but know, I think evil toward him. I like him not.
And now my good wishes I leave thee.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Go not.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Seeing there were tears in her eyes, he stooped to kiss
her carelessly; then, drew from her restraining hand and
went out.</p>

<p class='c011'>Atlana was left to weep inconsolably. Well she loved
her husband; and hard to bear was his growing indifference.
Now had come this new terror, this suddenly
sprung up cloud of war, and the injustice of such a contest
could presage only defeat. For the remainder of
the day she continued alone, given over to despondency,
and dreading lest any eye should witness her plight.</p>

<p class='c011'>Before night, many were the aching hearts on the island
beside the queen’s. The wives of high and low degree
had alike fallen to sorrowing. Mourning was rife among
the females of the land, and grew in intensity from the
hard-heartedness of the males, who had no patience with
such puerile manifestations, and, therefore, laughed at
them, derided. When some wives took courage to hint
of the possibility of defeat, they were so withered by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>scorn as to run for hiding places; and it was days before
quite a goodly number rallied sufficiently to show themselves.
The women of Atlantis could imagine and suffer
thereby as ably as their sisters of to-day.</p>

<p class='c011'>As the preparations grew brisker, more despairing became
these Atlantean women. As for the queen, she
only brightened when in presence of the king. Then
she was strong. Thus he knew not of the agony she
was enduring—could not have appreciated it had she
disclosed it. Once he even complimented her upon her
sensible way of accepting the matter, she smiling back
in a weary manner that was lost upon him, so centered
was he in self. But, day by day, she grew more fond, if
possible, so that his eyes opened somewhat; and, at last,
he exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Atlana, where didst thou get such heart? Well would
it be if thou hadst children.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Children! Torment me not!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The cry was tragic. The king, though amazed, scoffed:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou sayest well. They are but a torment.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I meant not that they are a torment. It is torment
that I have them not!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Wildly she spoke, unsealing her lips upon this subject,
and to the astounding of the king, as she continued:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why speakest thou of children, and at this time?
It is hard to bear. To have no child to look upon, to
nurse, to clasp! Here is the heart of a mother, but
where is the child to cling to it, to bless it? I am alone—alone!”</p>

<p class='c011'>She bowed her head to hide the bursting tears. The
king, touched, attempted consolation.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Grieve not, Atlana. I care for children but to vex
Oltis. As life is, they are ever a trouble.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>“I care not about Oltis. For trouble, fathers have no
trouble. It is the mothers alone—who have to bear—that
have the right to murmur. But I should never murmur.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nay, for a queen need have no care.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I should have care, and hail it, were I many times a
queen.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Such strong yearning was in her face that the king exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Atlana, what is it? What is upon thee? Is it this
matter of war?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Day and night I think of naught else. Hard have I
tried to be brave. Atlano, go not from me. The pain
I cannot bear.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There is no need for pain. We go to lay Pelasgia
low. And I shall come again. Think, thou art the wife
of a king. Trouble me no longer with bodings of evil.
Would we had a child. It would take my place.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Atlana sighed, and raised her head, determined to say
no more. Relieved that her tears had ceased, Atlano
said more gently:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Let us sail down to the harbor. There have the vessels
of all the ports gathered. It will cheer thee but to
look upon them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Fine cheer, indeed, was this for such an aching heart!
The queen looked at him, thinking he meant to jest.
But no, his earnestness was too apparent. Already had
his face brightened at the prospect. So she forced a
smile, and, calling her ladies, gave the necessary orders.</p>

<p class='c011'>Shortly, herself, the king, and a few of the nobles, with
their wives, went gliding down Luith to the harbor. But
great heaviness of spirit was beneath the smiles of these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>women; and this heaviness increased when, upon arriving
at the harbor, they beheld the many war vessels in
brave array, with pennants flying, and men crowding their
decks. Bitter was it to listen to the exulting speeches of
Atlano and his nobles; bitterer, to listen to the acclamations
of those on deck and shore. The nobles’ wives
looked from their queen to each other, but could derive
no comfort, no hope. There was not one to lighten the
gloom of the others among these suffering women.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER III.<br /> <span class='large'>ATLANTIS VERSUS PELASGIA.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>A few days later the Atlantean fleet sailed to the
eastward to invade this upstart Pelasgia—these Pelasgians
that had come from Western Asia by way of the Cyclades
to make an abiding place in the Greece of to-day, as
well as the islands of the Ægean Sea.</p>

<p class='c011'>A mysterious people were the Pelasgians. Their appearance
among the past known races of the earth was
sudden; their extinction has been complete. Yet we
know they were peaceful, and fond of agriculture; that,
under the favoring skies of their adopted land, they became
the greatest merchants and sailors of most ancient
times, antedating the renowned Phœnicians; that from
Greece they passed over to Southern Italy, there, perhaps,
to inaugurate that “golden age of Saturn,” when
peaceful agricultural pursuits superseded the piratical
habits of the Carians and Leleges. But this is little.</p>

<p class='c011'>However, their monuments endure. These are the
vast Cyclopean remains of Greece and Asia that puzzle
while they amaze. Evidently intended for fortification,
they were built of huge polygonal stones, fitted together
without cement and mortar, so perfectly as to survive the
structures of succeeding ages and races. These are all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>that are left to point to a people who, though forced
everywhere to yield to the conqueror, must yet have
been possessed of indomitable energy and perseverance.
Though ineffaceable are their invisible imprints for good.</p>

<p class='c011'>Under Pelasgus, their leader and king, this colony won
renown so quickly that it is no wonder Atlano should
doubt its existence. But this knowledge proved the impetus
he had been desiring. Now there was new life in
the mere thought of the stifling of this menacing people.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus the fleet went gaily sailing along the Middle Sea,
so high were the hopes, so positive the convictions of
success.</p>

<p class='c011'>The skies were favorable: and the time dragged not,
because of the ravages made upon the coasts to the left.
At length the islands off the southern shore of Greece
were sighted; and there came into view what could only
be some Pelasgian vessels. As the great fleet bore down
upon them, these took to flight, and made such good
speed, the while warning other vessels they met, that all
were out of sight before reaching the southern point of
Attica.<a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c012'><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Up the western coast they speeded to their port,<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c012'><sup>[11]</sup></a> whilst
the Atlanteans, mistaking their route, rounded Attica to
sail up its eastern coast. Nothing here invited them except
some outlying hamlets, which they pillaged and destroyed.
When well along between Attica and Euboea,
the fleet lay to, and many warriors disembarked.</p>

<p class='c011'>These advanced through Bœotia, the surprised Pelasgians
fleeing before them into Thessaly. But quickly
did Thessaly prepare for defense, calling as leader Deucalion,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>who, with his family, dwelt at Larissa, on its
southern shore.</p>

<p class='c011'>This Deucalion was revered and beloved; and it was
whispered that he possessed mysterious powers that
could come only of the gods. So none but himself must
lead these ready Thessalonians.</p>

<p class='c011'>He, most willing, hastily gathered his neighbors. And
then these Pelasgians of Thessaly met the invaders, gave
them fierce battle, and forced them back, even through
Bœotia, and into Attica. Meanwhile, a few of the Atlantean
vessels had proceeded along the coast of Attica
and Bœotia, seeking pillage; and, all too soon, came upon
Larissa, whose simple homes and cultivated lands were
on either side of its gentle stream and by the coast.
Here, at this inviting spot, they paused to descend
upon its women and children, every man having gone
with Deucalion. When home after home had been pillaged
and destroyed, these defenseless ones fell before the
red warriors to plead, agonized, for mercy. But when
unanswered, spurned, their importunities changed to despairing
cries for Deucalion, which the marauders were
only too quick to distinguish.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus the leader inquired of one of the shrieking
women, in a tone she could not fail to understand, “Deucalion?”</p>

<p class='c011'>She, foolish one, by her gestures and pointing, made
them comprehend that this Deucalion had led his fellows
southward to meet the invading foe.</p>

<p class='c011'>Grim was then the laughter of the Atlanteans. To
this succeeded desire to know which was Deucalion’s
home. They were about to inquire, when the same
woman, of her frenzy, cried:</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>“See—Pyrrha, Pyrrha! The wife of Deucalion!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The Atlanteans, following her glance, again comprehended.
Under some trees, at a little distance, were
kneeling, entwined, a woman and two children. The
leader eagerly asked:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is that the wife of Deucalion?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The woman, understanding, bowed in affirmation.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And the children of Deucalion?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Again the woman bowed her “Yes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a swift movement of the chief and his men
toward the group. Perceiving this, Pyrrha, with her
children, arose, and the three stood in passive dignity.
But less swift grew the approach of the marauders, as
they the better beheld this Pyrrha, this fair, noble, most
lovely woman, who, with the mother fear in her eyes, was
holding tightly a youth well grown and a little maiden.
For the moment a feeling akin to reverence came upon
the fierce men, so that they halted. But the leader,
overcoming this, went still nearer, and demanded:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Give me the children!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Of her intuition, Pyrrha understood. Tighter grew
her grasp, as she besought mercy with her eyes. But
the chief hardened only the more, for he was calculating
upon the ransom that these children must bring. So he
laid his hand upon the youth, strong in his purpose.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then fine it was to behold the youth’s flashing eyes,
his proud crest, and the brave air with which he turned
to repel this mighty-looking warrior. Though Pyrrha,
by tone and grasp, endeavored to restrain him, as she, in
her Pelasgian, pleaded for mercy. Vain, however, were
her sweet tones. The chief’s hands went about young
Hellen; the cruel men pressed sore; and Pyrrha and her
daughter, bereft, sank upon their knees, heart pressed to
heart, to cry to heaven for help.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>But again went the hands at their work. The mother
was drawn back ruthlessly, and the maiden wrenched
from her arms. Brave, unyielding, Pyrrha struggled to
her feet, prepared to follow, to drag her children back.
But the evil spirits held high their captives, and gathered
about them in mass as they moved onward to the
ships. Dark became everything to Pyrrha; her lovely
body tottered, and she fell unconscious. Heaven at last
was kind.</p>

<p class='c011'>The other women, with their children, collected about
her. But to all efforts for her revival, she responded not.
So they forbore, to fall on their knees, and gaze dumbly
at the vessels, which, with booty and captives, were already
beginning the journey southward. When these
were out of sight, they arose, their thought only for the
miserable creature who had revealed Deucalion’s family
to the despoilers. As one, they fell upon her with their
tongues; and of her it need hardly be told that, for the
balance of her life, it would have been better had she
never been born.</p>

<p class='c011'>The despoilers hastened southward to hear evil. The
brave Atlanteans who had disembarked to destroy these
Pelasgians, had met with defeat. Yes, Atlano had been
pressed back into Attica by Deucalion, and there had
been routed by a small army under Pelasgus. In consequence
the ranks of the Atlanteans could only tear their
way to the coast, many dying as they went of exhaustion
or wounds, so that Atlano with the other survivors
appeared but as a handful to those awaiting them on the
ships.</p>

<p class='c011'>When Atlano was again on his own vessel, his rage
and humiliation were so intense that none dared to venture
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>near him to tell of the presence of the two young
captives. Even Maron, his chief attendant, kept aloof
and eyed him in fear—the great, grim, swarthy Maron,
who had never known awe until now.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the king had not been long on board when, as he
stood gazing upon the shore of this uncrushed Pelasgia,
he heard a sound as of sobbing, and that not far from
him. Surprised, he listened for some seconds, and then
signed to Maron. The latter came forward eagerly,
while the others of the vessel scarcely breathed in their
interest.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is that noise, Maron?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Most gracious king, it cometh from the two children
made captive on the coast above, at a place where some
of our vessels landed for booty.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who took them?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Most gracious king, it was the chief captain, Zekil.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Let them be brought before me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Maron signed to an officer, who hastened to the middle
of the vessel, where there was a small apartment
used for storage, to return with the two miserable ones.
When these beheld the fierce, dark red face of the king,
they cried out in alarm.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Bring the rod,” ordered the king, “and let Zekil come
before me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The two children had fallen on their knees to supplicate
for deliverance. This Atlano well understood from
their signs, their tones, their agony. With contempt he
looked down upon them until the bronze rod was
brought. At his word a blow upon the back of each
brought the hapless pair to their feet. But their tears
had ceased, and, with eyes shining of indignation, they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>held to each other. Their shoulders were smarting,
but the pain was as nothing beside the indignity, for
these children had known only tenderness and reverence
hitherto.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then, as the youth Hellen turned from his sister to
flash at him a look as haughty, as fierce, Atlano smiled
in derision, and asked:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Maron, is this the son of a king?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Most gracious King, he is the son of a great chief.
Zekil knoweth; and yonder he cometh.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Soon Zekil was on board, and kneeling to the king.
When bidden to arise, he stood up as if well satisfied
with himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Zekil, whence came these children?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Most gracious King, we brought them from the coast
above.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Whose children are they?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Most gracious King, the people whom we fell upon
were ever calling upon their father, as if he had all
power. It was ‘Deucalion!’ ‘Deucalion!’ on every
side.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Deucalion!” Atlano gasped the word. Then, of his
astonishment and exultation, cried:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha—Deucalion! Art thou sure?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Most gracious King, their father is Deucalion.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Knowest thou who is Deucalion? Knowest thou
who he is, Zekil?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Even Zekil was shrinking back at the fury of his tone.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He is the one who headed the horde—that drove us
back—into the way of loss, ruin. But for Deucalion, we
would have swept from earth this Pelasgia!</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yea, and as they thronged about him, and pressed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>against us, it was to the cry of ‘Deucalion—Deucalion!’
And we fled before this ‘Deucalion!’” He hissed the
word at the terrified children.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now to pay him—now to pay him! And it shall be
fine ransom! Ah, what ransom will I have for you, ye
thrice-cursed children of Deucalion!”</p>

<p class='c011'>He raised his hand as if to smite. Æole, comprehending,
looked full in his face, calmly but beseechingly.
And, as he, for the first time, obtained a clear view of the
sweet, innocent, fair, lovely countenance of this child of
thirteen, and received the appealing look of eyes beautiful
like violets, eyes of a color unknown in Atlantis, the
hand, losing force, fell to his side.</p>

<p class='c011'>Further, as he continued to stare into these eyes, and
note the gestures of the small, perfect hands, he understood
that she was imploring their return to Pelasgia.
But, at his frowning shake of the head, she desisted, to
speak in quick, firm tone, to his comprehension:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then free my brother, and I will stay.”</p>

<p class='c011'>At perceiving the king’s threatening hand, Hellen had
raised his own to ward off the blow. Great was his
astonishment when the king’s hand fell to his side, as he
was not aware of Æole’s look or gestures. But, at her
words, he started, shocked, and faced her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Æole, thou knowest not what thou askest. Thinkest
thou I will go, and leave thee here, to the mercy of
these?” And he looked with scorn at King Atlano, who
was quick to interpret his words.</p>

<p class='c011'>In spite of himself, Atlano could not but admire Hellen’s
courage. He glanced from one to the other, the
uncowed demeanor of both so impressing him that he
said to those in attendance:</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>“They are a noble pair, this brother and sister. If we
take naught of the spoil of Pelasgia with us to Atlantis,
we are rich in them, for their value must bring us
fine ransom, and before the sun of the morrow. Meanwhile,
let them be held in honor. Maron, lead them
whence they came.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then he turned to speak apart with Zekil. And Maron
conducted the youth and maiden to the outside room.</p>

<p class='c011'>Later, there was a conference of the king and his few
surviving nobles and chief captains when it was decided
that the Atlantean fleet would remain where it was, and, on
the morrow, dictate terms for the ransom of the captives.</p>

<p class='c011'>After Atlano had sent away his nobles and captains,
he went to look upon the sufferers, and found them reclining
upon some cushions, in the very stupor of grief.
They heeded him not as he stood and watched them.
And many forms did his thoughts take as he noted their
beauty and grace. The one that would recur most often
was, “I would almost keep them in spite of many ransoms.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But, as it proved, there was no ransom on the morrow.
For, that night, the vessels of the Pelasgians, hurriedly
brought together from every available point, so harassed
and destroyed a portion of the Atlantean fleet that the
remainder was forced to speed off in the early morning,
leaving to an uncertain future the wished-for ransom.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus the invading fleet passed away. And the bitterly
weeping children stood straining their eyes at the
beloved, the fast disappearing shores. At about the time
that their dear Pelasgia was beyond their view, Deucalion
rejoined his still unconscious wife, and learned from those
about her of this terrible bereavement.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IV.<br /> <span class='large'>THE PELASGIAN CAPTIVES.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Sacred mountain, uplands, shore, and harbor became
black with people, as the returning fleet drew inward.
The enthusiastic welcomings were all that the proudest
conqueror could wish. Yet these islanders, fearing they
were but lukewarm in their manifestations to these so
victorious, grew but the more enthusiastic—until it came
upon them that the fleet was moving with ominous slowness,
that few were the pennants, that there were no
responses, and that the decks were looking wofully scant
of men.</p>

<p class='c011'>Almost as one they became mute; and each began to
eye his fellows in doubt. Could it be that victory had
not been with Atlantis? Fast fell their hopes, until wild
became the speculations as to who were returning, who
were left dead in a far-off clime.</p>

<p class='c011'>Gradually, the cry of terror overspread harbor, shore,
uplands, and mountain; and its sounds were the first to
fall upon the king’s ears as the fleet drew into Luith’s
outlet.</p>

<p class='c011'>Quick were the king and his nobles in boarding the
galleys awaiting them. No looks were there for the
masses, looking gloomily on from shore and docks,
though a few of the latter tried hard to shout welcomes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>that would stick in their throats. As the galleys began
to move off, the gloom deepened, until amazement lightened
it a little; for what meant these two fair children that
Maron and an officer were bearing from the king’s vessel to
a galley? Also, why was this galley keeping so near
that of the king? The tongues were loosened, and conjecture
ran high until the warmen and sailors began to
disembark. These were at once surrounded by the impatient
beholders on land; and, as Atlano and his nobles
moved away, they knew the listeners were hearing of the
dead, so eloquent of anguish grew the air.</p>

<p class='c011'>Useless was it to stop their ears. What was the outer
hearing to the powerful inward faculty that naught could
render deaf?</p>

<p class='c011'>Onward, up the beautiful Luith, glided the king and
his nobles, their eyes ever turned from the galleys that
had come to meet certain nobles nevermore to be seen
in Atlantis. Of these Phiro was one—Phiro, the young,
the ardent. Then they thought of the wives awaiting
these, the non-returning, and grew abject in their humiliation
and fear. Mute, they glided by the palaces whose
marble landing places were covered with anxious observers.</p>

<p class='c011'>When they reached the upper part of the stream and
beheld banks and heights swarming with people, and
many galleys coming toward them, the king drew more
closely under his awnings, that he might not respond to
the cheers of these loyal subjects who were content in
that he was of those returning.</p>

<p class='c011'>And there, at the royal landing place, were priests also
awaiting him. In spite of the anxiety, shout after shout
went up from all sides as his galley touched the granite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>steps. But terrible was the hush when the king came
forth, unsmiling, unanswering. After the steps were ascended,
his chariot entered, and he was driven off, they
knew their every fear was verified.</p>

<p class='c011'>Shivering with dismay, they looked on in silence as
the downcast nobles, now that the king no longer needed
their attendance, thought of their homes, and, entering
their chariots, drove off. But there came diversion for
the time when the half-fainting captives were borne to a
chariot, and driven after the king.</p>

<p class='c011'>The priests, who were of inferior rank, were about to
drive to the temple when these children appeared. They
waited until they were gone, when one spoke out to the
captain of the galley that had borne them:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sir Captain, whence are those children?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Priest Kluto, Maron telleth that they are of Pelasgia,
and the children of a great chief.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I knew it!” exclaimed a swarthy man, a Kabyle
of the Amazirgi.<a id='r12'></a><a href='#f12' class='c012'><sup>[12]</sup></a> “Before I lost this arm, and when I
was in Shaphana, I saw these Pelasgians. Fair were some
even as these children, and of foreheads as straight.
Marked ye their foreheads?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I marked them!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And I!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And I!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then, for the first time in the history of the island, these
Atlanteans began to regard the receding foreheads everywhere
about them with less than the usual favor.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thereupon, another priest, of his shrewdness, warned:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Such foreheads come not of the gods. Call to mind
that ye spring from Poseidon. Was not the forehead of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>Poseidon even as our foreheads? Are not our foreheads
as his? Then have a care. Else will ye mock!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But how fair, how white are they!” demurred a yellow
man of the Eskaldi.<a id='r13'></a><a href='#f13' class='c012'><sup>[13]</sup></a> “Of a truth, the gods love such
a color!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Get thee beyond the mountains of Shaphana,<a id='r14'></a><a href='#f14' class='c012'><sup>[14]</sup></a> whither
we found thy tribe famishing,” scoffed the priest. “I speak
but to Atlanteans. Atlanteans, we are of the gods—we
are red. But other things are for our thoughts than
skins and foreheads. We are the children of Poseidon.
Let us look to it that we anger him not. For, what a
day is this!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then, shaking his head in a manner that drew forth
the cries and groans of the bystanders, he made the
sign, and was driven off. The other priests followed.</p>

<p class='c011'>During this conversation more galleys had approached;
and from one got out a few warmen and sailors. These
were at once questioned by men, women, and children.
But short was the listening, when the air was rent with
anguish. Then those unbereaved led the mourners to
their homes, themselves sick of shame and despair.</p>

<p class='c011'>What had come upon Atlantis? Never had a king
been so humiliated. Never before had the ships returned
without brilliant booty. Fun-hi was as a grain of sand
to this. And, ah, the non-returning! Woe to the stricken
ones—the desolated homes!</p>

<p class='c011'>The thinking ones, in their places of retirement, trembled
at what this might mean.</p>

<p class='c011'>The king, with his attendants, drove on to the palace
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>court. He alighted; and, waving off the clustering ones,
passed on to the queen’s apartments. He would tell
Atlana that this had come of her croakings.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Atlana was standing alone in her bower room, her
arms outstretched, the glad tears pouring. She hastened
to embrace him, crying:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Atlano, I see thee again, and not harmed! The gods
be thanked forever!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yea, thou seest me again. Though better were it
had I been left to feed the birds in Pelasgia!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Could I but cheer thee.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She kissed his hand and yearned for the embrace
that would not come.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is because of thy croaking, Atlana. From the
first thou didst look with cold eye upon it. And the
other women of the land have helped thee. Thy bodings
of evil, and theirs, have helped towards our loss, our ruin!
Knowest thou not the power of thought?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Say not so, Atlano. Say not our thoughts could
have such power. Small cheer would it bring to mourning
wives and daughters. Ah, wretched Atlanteans—wretched
women! And to think I could greet thee with
smiles, with these sorrowing ones about us! It is cruel—cruel!
But my heart will leap that thou hast come
back, though with no kiss—no fond clasp within thine
arms.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She bent her head as a tall lily might when overborne
by a bitter blast, and then raised her eyes appealingly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yea, I have come back, and in what manner? Hard
is it to raise my head, harder to look about me. I am craven!
Small heart have I for kiss or clasp. But here they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>are, since thou dost ask for them.” And he proceeded
to do both so coldly that she drew away from him in
haste, her eyes flashing, her cheeks crimsoning, that she
had thus besought him. But her indignation was short.
It was plain that he was suffering sore in his humiliation;
and her wifely pity triumphed when he began to pace
moodily. Only love and tenderest sympathy shone in
her eyes when at last he ejaculated:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Could I but hide myself. Would I were a priest!”—the
last being uttered in derision.</p>

<p class='c011'>Hoping to divert him, she whispered:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Atlano, knowest thou the high priest is dying?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nay.” He stopped, interested.</p>

<p class='c011'>“They have looked for him to pass away through the
night.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And Oltis—is he dying likewise?” Grim was his
laugh.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oltis is well. He hath been cruel to his father. Yet,
to the people, he mourneth as a tender son.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The sly, smooth face! So he is to be high priest as
I come back. It bodeth evil.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What meanest thou?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It bodeth evil for Atlantis that I come back with my
spirit sore to find Oltis stepping into the place of high
priest. Would this matter had naught to do with line.
It would be well if the chief priests came not of the blood
of the kings. It could be changed.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This last idea seemed to please him, as he grew absorbed
over it, and even smiled. But the queen shuddered.
Well she dreaded any further departure from the
ancient customs. Already had there been enough such
to cause her faithful, devout spirit untold suffering and
fear. She waited a little, and then said cheerfully:</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>“Let us hope that Oltis wilt do better as high priest.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou knowest as well as I there is no good in him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The queen sighed, and said almost under her breath:
“Well was it for his wife that she died early. But his
poor children!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And his poor, poor niece, poor of a truth before he
hath done with her!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Atlano, since thou didst leave, he hath kept Electra
from me. He hath pleaded the sore state of Olto, that
he hath ever need of her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hath Olto been sick so long?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“From the time thou didst leave, he failed. Soon he
was too weak to serve in the great temple even. The
other temples thou knowest he had not visited in a year.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And now Oltis will have charge over them all.
Would the law were not as this. Would it could be
changed.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Call to mind that Oltis hath no son. His nephew
Urgis cometh after him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yea, that followeth that Urgis will leave the temple
at Chimo, to be the chief priest in our temple when Oltis
is high priest. I could take cheer in the thought that
one is of like cunning with the other. So Oltis will be
high priest, and Urgis chief priest of our great temple.
The two will need a firm hand, Atlana.” Again his laugh
rang grim.</p>

<p class='c011'>The queen had become very pale. Noting this, Atlano
continued, “But, to change, I have brought thee a gift.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A gift!” She smiled rosily.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have brought thee thy wish, children. Ah, thou
dost not see! We have taken two captives, the son and
daughter of a great Pelasgian chief. If ransom cometh
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>not, they are thine. Thou wilt care for them, wilt cause
them to be taught our tongue and habits. Here, in this
palace, will they stay to be treated as are the children of
the king.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Much did he enjoy her astonishment, and the yearning
look that came into her eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But how old are they, Atlano?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The boy is sixteen years; the girl, thirteen.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And their parents are dead?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nay, nay, they live!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They live, and without their children?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yea, yea, and without their children!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is a horror.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is a delight.” Most mocking was his laugh.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou meanest it not.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But I do. These are the children of Deucalion. To
him we owe our loss, ruin. If ransom cometh not, I can
well pay him. Atlana, the girl is most fair.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The queen shivered, and her eyes fell.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The boy is noble of look and brave. He will be a
warrior, and, in the coming time, can help to fall upon
Pelasgia. What delight if, in battle, he should slay his
father!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The queen turned from him, and a cry of torment
escaped her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Atlana, there was enough of such noise ere I went
from thee. I mean this I tell thee.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She was ghastly in her paleness.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Atlana, thou lookest far from well. It may be thou
art not able to look upon these captives now. I will
show them to thee on the morrow.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I would see them now, now!”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>The king pulled a cord hanging from the wall, and the
queen’s pygmy entered.</p>

<p class='c011'>This pygmy, who was but four feet in height, had
been captured in Afrita<a id='r15'></a><a href='#f15' class='c012'><sup>[15]</sup></a> near the middle part, together
with many of his tribe of Akka; and it was ten years since
the forlorn creatures had entered upon servitude in Atlantis.
But Azu was fortunate in that he had been given
to the queen. Her heart had gone out to him, as it ever
did toward the wretched; and, of her kindness, she often
questioned as to his former life, receiving crude descriptions
of his tribe’s home in the great forest, and boastful
accounts of its ability and prowess—for quickly had he
learned Atlantean, being but a child when captured, and
now scarcely twenty.</p>

<p class='c011'>Very bright was Azu, and affectionate, though most
peculiar of look because of his large round head, snout-like
projection of the jaws, receding chin, flat chest, huge
paunch, and angular, projecting lower limbs. Further,
his grotesqueness of body was enhanced by his garb.
This, in color, was flaming red, and consisted of a tunic,
close-fitting, short lower garments, pointed cap, and
pointed shoes. He looked a goblin. His one beauty
was his hands, which were small and well formed. Moreover,
his teeth were strong and pearly, and served somewhat
to lighten the darkness of his visage, as he grinned
without ceasing.</p>

<p class='c011'>With feet turning inward and a waddling or lurching
of the body, he approached, to fall most suddenly flat on
his face before the king. Smiling, Atlano ordered:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Azu, arise. Speed to Maron, who is in the first small
room. Bid him bring hither the captives.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>Azu then arose, and backed to the door with head
bent low. When he went out, the queen sank on a
couch, and shaded her eyes with her hands. In a few
moments, he reëntered to lurch, bow, and say:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Gracious King, Maron and the children are without.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Bid them come in.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Azu went out. Then entered Maron, half bearing Æole,
whilst Hellen walked feebly beside him. Maron laid Æole
on a couch, and then made his obeisance to the queen, who
had arisen. After receiving this, she bade him place a
chair for the youth near his sister. Into this Hellen sank
in weariness. Then Atlana moved beside them to gaze
upon Æole, who lay back with eyes closed, breathing
faintly. And, as she gazed, the queen thought the maiden’s
loveliness more of heaven than earth. Shortly, with
tears starting, she turned to look upon the noble, handsome
youth, who was regarding her so despairingly,
and she the more marveled. Where got these children
their exceeding fairness, their straightness of feature,
their grace of form and face? What a color was the
maiden’s hair, so rich in its brownish red, so golden
where the sun was kissing it! What must her eyes be,
for the youth’s were blue as the deepest skies!</p>

<p class='c011'>Of her admiration and compassion, the queen leaned
over and kissed the sweet, straight forehead with such
fervor that Æole opened her eyes. One look from their
beautiful blue depths so stirred Atlana that she kissed
her again and again. Then, as she perceived Hellen gazing
in woe upon her, she felt a sudden love for both.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Altano, they are mine. My heart leapeth. They
will be my children. At last the gods pity me!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“As thou wilt, Atlana. They are thine unless ransom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>cometh. Though, I have the mind not to yield them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ransom! Ah, I forgot! They have a mother, a
father. What is there more than woe to lose such children!
I beseech thee, send them this day to their
home.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou art a driveler!” With fierce look he turned to
leave; and, as he strode away, added, “Fit wife art thou
for Olto!”</p>

<p class='c011'>But she went after him. “Again I ask that thou wilt
send them to their home, and this day. Choose between
them and me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He half turned, and cast at her a peculiar look, in
which showed wavering. Then, in smooth, persuasive
tone, said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Atlana, it is for thee to wait. I have to please my
nobles in this. They look for ransom. It is best to
seem to hearken to them for the time. After the sting
of this loss is less keen, they will the better yield. Further,
have a care for thyself. Where is thy trust as a
wife?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou wouldst do better had I less trust, as thou
callest it. There are some who have no eye for such—some
who can be stirred only by lack of thought, lack
of feeling, lack of faith,<a id='r16'></a><a href='#f16' class='c012'><sup>[16]</sup></a> until they become as full of life
as were the dying under that draught of our cousin,
Viril!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou meanest that draught that gave youth, never-ending
youth?” asked he, eagerly, unmindful of her
reproach.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yea.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>“Would we knew that draught, if it was found, for
Viril died.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We know that he lived long, so long that he came
to wish for death. Without doubt, he ceased to take it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Would he had left the word to us. Would it could
again be found! Would we, in our seeking, could”—He
paused in fear. He had been incautious. But
Atlana, unheeding his words, for her thought had returned
to the captives, implored:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Think well upon it, Atlano. In a few days come to
me with the word that these children will go back to
Pelasgia.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Relieved, he answered mildly, “Trouble me not with it
now.” And again would have gone.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yield to me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Take away thy hand. I must to Oltis, whom thou
likest so well. Later will we think upon this.” And,
pushing aside her detaining hand, he passed from the
apartment.</p>

<p class='c011'>The queen again leaned over Æole; but shortly
beckoned to Hellen. Taking his hand, she sat beside
them, looking from one to the other with such affection
that they revived somewhat. This was the first sympathy
they had received, and no mother’s could have been
tenderer.</p>

<p class='c011'>After a little Æole sat up, and the relieving tears fell
fast. When the queen had wiped these well away, she
spoke reassuringly to Hellen; and then the two, by their
signs, made her to understand how grateful were her
sympathy and quick affection.</p>

<p class='c011'>Soon Azu brought them some refreshment, the while
refreshing their spirits to the extent that they even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>laughed. Here was a novelty of novelties. Whereupon,
and out of his goodness of heart, he became overjoyed,
and to express this, executed some extraordinary leaps
that made them laugh the more. Finally, at the queen’s
behest, he struck off into a wild, weird dance that he had
learned in the inmost recesses of the Afrite forest. At
this their tears were paralyzed, and the laughing,
strengthened.</p>

<p class='c011'>They were now in good condition for the services of
the lady Elna. She showed them to rooms near the
queen, ordered for them fresh clothing, and bade Azu
conduct them to the bath. Afterward they reposed.</p>

<p class='c011'>As the days passed, they became more cheerful, owing
to the thoughtfulness of the queen. Every morning,
they drove with her about the environs of the sacred
mountain, even going long distances on the great plain
to the left. This plain much amazed them, so boundless
was it, so intersected with canals and streams, so cultivated
in every tree and plant that could please the eye
and gratify the palate. Moreover, marvelous was the
great ditch about it, that, they were told, was hundreds
of miles in circumference; whose depth of a hundred feet
was almost incredible; whose width was as that of a
river.</p>

<p class='c011'>Further, there were the great quarries to the north end
of the sacred mountain, from which were taken out the
stones red, white, and black, that were used in building the
palaces. Here many men worked; and even the pygmies,
who showed a strength and endurance wonderful
for their size.</p>

<p class='c011'>Also, there were fountains leaping everywhere, great
cisterns roofed over, many bath houses, and race courses
with their attendant horses.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>Stupendous were the pyramids, several of which arose
on the great plain. With astonishment was it heard that
these contained the dead. That of the royal family arose
towards the summit of the sacred mountain, to the westward
of a purling stream. In front of it was the temple
of Poseidon and Cleito, that now was never opened, its
sanctity being preserved by an inclosure of gold. They
were not long in comprehending that here had been the
home of Poseidon and Cleito, here the birthplace of their
ten sons.</p>

<p class='c011'>But their chief entertainment was found in the great
hall of the palace and its corridors. This hall ran through
the center of the rectangle forming the front of the palace,
and to the court; whilst its corridors ran to the right
and left, and overlooked the court. Everywhere were the
walls covered with sculptured slabs of alabaster, twelve
feet in height, representing events in the history of the
island. There were recorded battles, sieges, triumphs,
and exploits of the race course and chase. Even the
ceremonies of religion were portrayed. Beneath these
slabs were pictures engraved on copper, also historic.
Above the slabs were paintings of the different kings and
queens inclosed in borders of fine designs and brilliant
coloring. The pavement was of sculptured slabs of marble,
representing flowers and trees. At every doorway
were colossal winged lions or bulls, some human faced;
and all either of alabaster or greenstone. And numerous
were the columns of orichalcum, engraved, and the
statues of greenstone.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yes, here was entertainment, and almost forgetfulness
that there were such strange faces, such unknown tongues
about them.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>Before the month had passed, they were able to take
up certain duties, as well as to enter upon the study of
the alphabet and language of Atlantis. Every morning
they received instruction in the bower room; and, rather
strangely, when they had mastered the rudiments of the
language, the queen took it into her head to study Pelasgian.
It was not long before the bower room was a tower
of Babel on a small scale, as it rang with young voices,
and even laughter in which the queen had full part.
Well was it for Atlana that some lightness had entered
into her days.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus it happened that the queen accused herself when
her heart leaped at hearing from Atlano that the nobles
would not permit the captives’ return. It had even been
determined that they must enter upon their initiation into
the industries of the island at once. In consequence,
Hellen began to go about the adjacent parts with an
attendant, in order that he might obtain knowledge of
agriculture, sheep raising, and metal working. And
Æole quickly became proficient in embroidery, in the
spinning and weaving of cotton and wool, in flower culture,
and in poultry raising. Soon, like Queen Atlana,
she had her own particular flower garden, and her pets
among all our fowls of to-day with the exception of the
turkey. Soon, even, she was wearing robes similar in
fashion to the queen’s, of her own weaving and embroidering.
The queen never tired of exclaiming to the king
at the progress of this youth and maiden.</p>

<p class='c011'>But, though busy and outwardly cheerful, Hellen and
Æole ever longed for Pelasgia. They could not reconcile
themselves to this new life, in spite of its charm of
novelty, its many wonders. When they looked upon the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>magnificent temples and luxurious palaces, they thought
of the plain homes of Larissa to sigh, to grow faint.
Ever were the enchanting gardens fading away before
their dimming eyes, giving place to the simply cultivated
fields of Pelasgia, instead. The canals, aqueducts, and
pyramids were wonders they never could have dreamed
of, but, oh, for the river, the springs, the modest tombs of
their home! Pelasgia knew not this perfection of cereals
and fruits, these great race courses, the mighty elephants,
the lavish adornments of gold, silver, orichalcum, and
precious stones. Also, it knew not the lack of truth and
honor, the profligacy, the sensuality of these degenerate
islanders. Thus, the two, when alone together, could
talk but of their parents and home, as well as their dread
of the glitter and falsehood about them. Their only
balm was the love of the queen.</p>

<p class='c011'>The king they feared and disliked. Keen were they
to perceive the shadow he ever left upon the queen. She,
it was plain to see, was daily growing sadder. And, about
the palace it was whispered that the king’s profligacies
were causing this, as he had steadily progressed in wickedness
since his return from Pelasgia.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus these two Pelasgian captives grew to be Atlana’s
comfort, her alleviation. Indeed, she became bound up
in them as the weary months went by.</p>

<p class='c011'>The first year passed, and no offer of ransom arrived;
but Hellen and Æole ceased not to hope. The second
and third years dragged, and no word had been received.
Then each confessed a dread that their parents were no
more.</p>

<p class='c011'>When the third year had passed, the nobles often
hinted of the desirability of another invasion of Pelasgia;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>but always Atlano advised delay, for his martial spirit
had weakened under the sloth and indulgence of these
later years. He lived but for ease and sensuality.</p>

<p class='c011'>So, as the time was ripe, he put in operation long-devised
plans. Hellen and Æole were now to realize
in the fullest their most forlorn, helpless situation. The
tears that were but beginning to dry were about to fall
faster than ever.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER V.<br /> <span class='large'>THE ABDUCTION.</span></h2>

<p class='c010'>The queen, Æole, and Hellen had returned from the
seashore, where they had been watching a swimming
bout of the young nobles and the crowning of the victor.
After the glare of the hot sands, they were impatient to
be in their favorite cool nook of the garden. This was a
large green plat quite inclosed in sycamores and acacias
that bordered the side stream to the east. Here, when
her ladies had served some refreshment and been dismissed,
the queen spoke anxiously:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Æole, Hellen, I read the looks ye cast far over the
sea. Would ye could forget.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dear Queen Atlana,” returned Æole, “it is our wish
not to forget. The lotus is not for us. Most dear art
thou, as thou knowest. But ever, at sight of the sea,
cometh this wish to breast it, that we may learn of our
home. Ah, the drawing! Ah, the pain!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yea,” added Hellen, “when we look upon the sea,
we can but dash against our bars. This causeth us to go
so little to the shore. At sight of the luring, mocking
water that leadeth to Pelasgia, we grow sick of our
longing.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Had I my will, ye should go this day. If the king
would but heed my prayers.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>“Dear Queen, we know how often thou dost beseech
him for us, and we tremble.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Fear not that he would harm me. Too well doth
he need me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She smiled pathetically. Then into her face came
such a weary expression and succeeding far-away look
that the two fell to talking in subdued tones of lighter
matters; and, as they talked, Æole took up her
embroidery, which Hellen at once began to examine
and admire.</p>

<p class='c011'>While thus engaged with each other, the queen
aroused from her reverie, and regarded them intently.</p>

<p class='c011'>Æole was looking as the lilies in her white linen robe
embroidered in blue, which she herself had wrought
from spinning to completion. Wonderfully fair and perfect
was the face, and aglow with intelligence, character,
sweetness, purity. Of a strange beauty was the gold red
hair that curled from the low, straight forehead to fall
long from the pearly fillet; whilst her eyes were dark
blue stars, and touching the grace of every pose and
movement of her lovely form.</p>

<p class='c011'>As she gazed, the queen agonized, for perils were
threatening this innocent one; and she wondered if Hellen
had any inkling of these, any suspicions. He was so
handsome, fiery, generous, brave. It was not in him to
brook scorn or insult. Besides, how well did the two
love each other! What one would suffer in the other!</p>

<p class='c011'>The queen again closed her eyes to lose herself in sorrowing
over them, but not for long. Soon footsteps
were heard beyond the trees. She aroused to speak the
dread words:</p>

<p class='c011'>“The king.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>Æole also half arose, with the wild intent to run
away. Then, regaining self-possession, sat again; though,
when the king appeared she was trembling and paling
so as to alarm Hellen. “Strange,” he thought, “this
dread of Æole for the king. She knoweth liking for all
save him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>To the homesick Æole, this presence of the king was
doubly unbearable. She wished Hellen had not been
there, that she might have slipped away. The queen,
who comprehended her feeling, could only motion to
Atlano to sit beside herself, the while murmuring:</p>

<p class='c011'>“We have been to the sands.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I saw you as ye drove back. Thou goest there but
little, Æole.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She bowed in affirmation.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou likest not the water?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“King Atlano, I like the water, but it causeth me the
more to think of my home.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is time thou didst forget thy home, Æole. Hellen,
thou hast no such longing?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“King Atlano, my sister and myself feel the same.
At sight of the sea we sicken for our home.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The king frowned.</p>

<p class='c011'>“How old art thou, Hellen?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“King Atlano, I am nineteen.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou art of age to be a warrior. Wouldst thou be
a captain?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I would be a warrior like my father. I care not to
war for the sake of it, but I would joy to war if it was
to save my land, my home.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The queen glanced at him in reproof. His honesty
and fearlessness she was ever dreading. The king glared
for a moment, then, smiling, inquired:</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>“Æole, how old art thou?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“King Atlano, I am sixteen.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou art of age to be a handmaid. Æole, wouldst
thou be a handmaid in the great temple?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The queen checked a cry of dismay, and became so
white that Hellen, in his fear, moved nearer her.</p>

<p class='c011'>Æole, also, was alarmed, though, after taking the
queen’s hand, she spoke out with a fine bravery:</p>

<p class='c011'>“King Atlano, I would not be a handmaid. I would
stay with Queen Atlana while I am here.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“While thou art here? Hast thy stay a limit?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I fear it hath not a limit. But I am happy if I stay
with Queen Atlana. She holdeth the next place to my
parents and Hellen.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And she looked at the queen with most loving eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>Upon the king’s face came an expression that only
Atlana beheld. Her head whirled, and she fell back
upon her chair as if about to swoon. Hellen was quick
to raise her, while Æole flew for some water that
chanced to be upon the rustic table. The two then
bathed her brow and chafed her hands as they begged
her to revive.</p>

<p class='c011'>Atlano watched, unimpressed. When Atlana had sat
up with an arm of each faithful one about her, he said
sarcastically:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well didst thou manage, Atlana.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The three stared at him, confounded.</p>

<p class='c011'>He continued: “Thinkest thou any good can come of
this acting? Of a truth, if I cause thee such trouble, it
would be well to stay from thee ever.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Atlano, talk not thus!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I go now.” And he arose. “But I have to tell thee
that Æole and Hellen will leave thee.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>She also arose. “Hellen and Æole will leave me?
Thou wouldst jest!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Another handmaid is needed in the temple. Æole
hath been called. A messenger is wanted between the
temple and this place. Hellen is chosen.”</p>

<p class='c011'>A dread faintness came upon the queen. But she
urged:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Æole will die if she leaveth me. Spare her to me.
Thou knowest my fond feeling.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Æole will go, on the morrow, to the temple.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Atlano, call to mind that thou gavest me these children.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He laughed derisively. “I gave but to take away.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Atlano, have mercy. The temple is no place for
Æole—for any maiden—any woman.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Beware,” he vociferated, in warning tone. “Thou
ravest. Have a care. Thou wouldst mock.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mock!” Such meaning was in her look that his
lips paled. “Mock! Thou dost use that word, and to
me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Atlana, cease, or thou wilt have sorrow.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sorrow! What sorrow is like to this, to take Æole
from me. Say thou wilt not.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oltis is firm. Æole will serve in the temple. Hellen
will be the messenger.” And he turned as if to avoid
further insistence.</p>

<p class='c011'>She seized his hand, and implored, “What shall I say—do—that
thou wilt hear?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou canst say naught. I leave thee to think upon
it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>With this, he roughly withdrew his hand, and turning,
strode away.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>Most direful was this shadow. As nothing were the
longings, the homesickness. Æole became so wrought
with terror, that Atlana set aside her own woe in order
to comfort. As for Hellen, he paced as if beside himself
for a little. Then paused before the queen, declaring:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Æole shall not go to that temple. May her life
cease ere then. Thinkest thou, dear Queen, that I have
no eyes, no ears?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hellen, what knowest thou?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know—that—for all its fair outward look—evil
worketh within. The gods are thought of only in form.
Those priests would be gods, would rise in their flesh to
heaven. Have I not heard the whisperings of the people
as to the noise and mirth of the inner parts? Is not Oltis
without truth, full of guile? Is not the worship mocked?
Are not the animals yielded on the altar, yea, the serving
of handmaids, mockeries of the olden holy laws? Handmaids,
in truth!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Of his agony, he paused.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hellen, what more knowest thou?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What more? Is not this enough? What more
knowest thou?”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was no reply. But Æole spoke feebly:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hellen, may I die rather than go there. To be near
the king and those priests!” Her shuddering was so
excessive that Hellen was obliged to support her, while
he implored:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Æole, be brave. There will be a way out of this.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She hath not gone. I have a voice.” The queen
drew Æole to her, and whilst caressing her, and looking
upon her in her grace and innocence, thought:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, Æole, I could hate thee, but that thou art so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>dear! If I could die in my shame. If we could both
die. And once I was happy, in the young days of my
fond trust. How ages far they seem. It is that I have
lived before. Is this Atlano?”</p>

<p class='c011'>She fell to weeping in a quiet, hopeless way, so that
Hellen and Æole, in their turn, essayed what comfort
they could. Thus passed the weary day.</p>

<p class='c011'>The next morning, Maron was announced with a
message from the king. Æole was bidden to leave the
palace at noon. As the queen had been expecting this,
she was ready.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Maron, bear to the king my word that Æole shall
not leave me. I ask that he will no more of it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Maron withdrew.</p>

<p class='c011'>In an hour, appeared two officials of the temple, bearing
a written order from the high priest. The queen
dismissed them with a message that the king would come
to her. But answer was immediately returned that the
king was engaged, and that Oltis’ order must be obeyed,
as it was given of the gods.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the officials, Queen Atlana merely said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Bear the word to the high priest—that I will not
yield in this.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The officials departed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Shortly they returned with two others, and presented
an order for Æole’s immediate presence signed by Atlano
and Oltis. The queen’s answer was:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ye will bear to the king and high priest my word
that Æole shall not go.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But, gracious Queen,” demurred Ludor, the spokesman,
“this is to please Amen.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who sayeth it is to please Amen?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>“The high priest told me thus—after his most gracious
self, the king.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I believe it not.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The four drew back in dismay. How dared she to dispute
king and high priest. It was sacrilege. Never had
such been known.</p>

<p class='c011'>Courteously waving them off, she added:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Go to them with my words.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Notwithstanding their orders to use force, if necessary,
they withdrew in reverence, for the queen’s majesty and
fearlessness were most impressive as well as provocative
of sympathy.</p>

<p class='c011'>Upon the appearance of the unsuccessful four, the furious
king hastened to the palace; and burst into the bower
room to meet only the lady Rica, who informed him
that the queen was in the room adjoining. He entered
this to find Atlana leaning over Æole, whom she was
vainly trying to comfort. Drawing back, he beckoned
to her to follow him to an unoccupied apartment to one
side.</p>

<p class='c011'>When she had obeyed, and they could not be heard,
he vociferated:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou darest to set me at naught?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is not Amen, nor Poseidon, then.” Atlana was
grand in her brave dignity.</p>

<p class='c011'>He looked at her sidelong, and said more smoothly:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am but their worker.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have said that I believe it not.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He seized her hands, and even shook her as he hissed:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou wouldst set thyself against me, then. Dost
thou forget I am the king? That I can do with thee as
I will?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>“Shake me to death, if thou wilt. Yield me upon
thine altar, even. But thy sorrow and pain will follow.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He laughed mockingly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou dost forget the prophecy of thy father on his
bed of death, ‘<i>With Atlana at the palace no evil befalleth
Atlano</i>’?”</p>

<p class='c011'>He drew his breath hard, and averted his eyes before
her steady look. With assumed indifference, he replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was but the babble of age.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then am I free to visit Khemi—to visit the kindred
of my mother.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Never, Atlana! Thou hast sworn to me ever to stay
at this palace unless I grant thee leave.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou believest that prophecy. Thou canst never
harm me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Atlana, I wish thee no evil, but thou hast to obey me.
Thou hast to yield in this going of Æole.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Æole shall not go.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He leaned toward her, and whispered:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wouldst thou see her yielded on the altar? The
priests will have her either as gift or handmaid. We
have to please Amen that he may favor us.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The queen cried out in horror. It was too true that
human blood had defiled the altar. Shortly before the
invasion of Pelasgia, Oltis, then chief priest of the temple,
had offered as sacrifice, within the inner sanctuary, an
African captive—a king—at behest of Atlano, who desired
vengeance because of the latter’s refusal to reveal where
certain treasure of his massacred tribe was hidden.
Worse, the excuse for this great profanation had been
that Amen and Poseidon needed propitiation. All this
Atlano had confided to his wife.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>The queen, of her horror, spoke not for a little. Then
she towered almost to his height, as she cried:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Tell me not that Amen and Poseidon are as men!
Ye would make them as such—as frail, as wicked—in
that they give favor for favor! Mock them no further.
Make them no longer gods to suit your weak minds, your
base thoughts! They are gods—gods—above such feeble
doings of the flesh. Have done with this shield that
they must be vilely served to give favor, and all the other
shields!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Atlano was confounded.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yea, and the curse is already upon thee for that
dread mockery. The blood of that poor king is a
blight upon this island, a mildew; and thou wouldst add
another, further mock the gods. If thou hast heed for
their favor, hast thou no thought for their anger? Hast
thou no faint, deep feeling that evil broodeth over this
island? Hadst thou my dreams! Night after night they
come.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Atlana, thou art getting an old woman.”</p>

<p class='c011'>His tone was contemptuous, but his eyes had lost their
boldness.</p>

<p class='c011'>“More than that. I am ages old. Each night of
brooding care hath been as years.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What care canst thou have known?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Was he in earnest, or did he speak thus to hide even
from himself knowledge that she had suffered, and through
him? Atlana could not tell, but she would not upbraid.
Such had never been her fashion. Though better might
it have been if Atlano could have seen himself, as in a
glass, through her wifely chidings—at times.</p>

<p class='c011'>He continued in a tone strangely conciliatory:</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>“Thou art not well. New air will help thee. Too
long hast thou staid here in this palace. What thinkest
thou of a short stay on the western coast where the
breezes most have power—say Chimo? There the new
pyramid riseth high. Wilt thou go?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“With thee, yea.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But I have not time to go. In a few days is the festival
of our Father Poseidon.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I may take Æole?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Æole will leave for the temple now. It is time her
bearers were here.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou meanest she will go by force?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“If it needeth.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is only over my dead body she will go!” And
Atlana, spurred by her terror, fairly ran back to the
retiring room.</p>

<p class='c011'>But close upon her was Atlano, as she leaned over the
shrinking girl. Then, as they faced each other defiantly,
the king gave a low call to which came the answering of
many soft footsteps.</p>

<p class='c011'>The dazed queen next heard Rica shriek, and fall as
in a swoon. Then the hangings were thrust aside, and
there hastened in several of the guards of the great court
of the temple. At this outrage, the brave spirit might
well have succumbed; but instead, she threw herself upon
Æole and held her tight.</p>

<p class='c011'>Severe was the struggle between husband and wife;
but Atlana held on with that strength that comes of desperation,
until the king produced a taper, which one of
the guards lighted, and held to her nostrils. Then the
dauntless lady fell back into the arms that should have
been her stay, her shield, senseless; and was placed on a
couch, there to lie as if in deep slumber.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>Æole, who had fainted, was borne on a chair to the
courtyard, where a closed chariot was awaiting her;
whilst the mystified attendants looked on, and listened
to the plausible explanations of her bearers.</p>

<p class='c011'>Atlano remained with his wife until the day waned.
And none knew the secret of the queen’s yielding.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VI.<br /> <span class='large'>THE VOICE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Drear was the night to Hellen, given over as it was
to agony. He was torn with futile promptings; but,
toward morning, came slight alleviation, as soon he
would be with Æole. Scarce, though, had he arisen
from his almost untouched meal, than Maron appeared
with an order from the king. He was to go at once to
the harbor with a message for the chief priest of the temple
of Ouranos, and await answer.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Maron, it meaneth that the king would be rid of me.
I will not go.”</p>

<p class='c011'>No pity stirred within the huge swarthy Maron because
of this youth’s drawn face, his passionate, desperate outcry.
With grim smile, he replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou wilt speed. The king is in haste. Come.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I would first bid Æole good-morning.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Linger not, for the galley waiteth. Come—come.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The despairing youth complied; and, as he went, Maron
further enforced the king’s order. Though deaf was
Hellen. Wild, murderous thoughts were chasing through
his brain. He felt he could have strangled this pitiless
man beside him with delight, and thus whetted have
rushed upon the king. Hard—hard was it to forbear.</p>

<p class='c011'>Upon arriving at the galley, Maron was obliged almost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>to drag him on board; when at once it shot off—Maron
remaining to watch until it was out of sight.</p>

<p class='c011'>As Hellen sailed, torture the more possessed him.
Three times was he on the point of bidding the rowers
return. When over half way, his anguish conquered;
and he gave the order, the men obeying, dissatisfied, as
they were hoping to join some cronies at the port.</p>

<p class='c011'>Tardily the glum rowers retraced the way. Meanwhile,
Hellen’s fears so lightened that they almost ceased
to exist as the palace came into view; and, as he ascended
the steps of the landing place, he laughed at himself,
so much did the vicinage of Æole encourage him.</p>

<p class='c011'>He hastened to the courtyard, and was about to enter
when obliged to give way to a closed chariot that was
being driven therefrom.</p>

<p class='c011'>But, following this chariot, rode some guards of the
temple. As they dashed past, Hellen became rigid for
the moment. Now were his fears confirmed. That
chariot contained Æole. She was being borne to the
temple—was lost unless he could tear her from her captors.</p>

<p class='c011'>His inanity vanished. Madly he flew through the
palace grounds; and eschewing the grand roadway, made
a short cut up to the gateway of the outer court of the
great temple.</p>

<p class='c011'>Here he paused to gather breath and strength, until
he heard the chariot approaching. Then he stepped just
within the gateway, and waited, indifferent to the curious
looks of the few loitering guards.</p>

<p class='c011'>The chariot came through the gateway slowly. When
abreast of him, he sprang on its step, thrust aside the
curtains, and beheld his sister unconscious. In a second
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>he was beside her, and drawing her into his arms. Then
in defiance, he eyed the clustering guards, who were
seizing him as they bade him come out. And, with a
madman’s strength, shook them off, to hold his sister
the firmer.</p>

<p class='c011'>The guards, exclaiming in fierce tones, began to pull
him as if to pieces. Still he held on, the while looking
for some weapon with which to end their sufferings.
Death must come to them. It was their only saviour.</p>

<p class='c011'>Suddenly, a priest appeared beside the contestants.
It was Partlan, a creature of Oltis. As he looked within
the chariot, and perceived Hellen struggling, this priest
grinned much as a hyena does when assured of its prey;
and then felt for something within his vestment.</p>

<p class='c011'>With a sign to the guards to relinquish their hold, he
drew forth a tube much like a siphon. As the luckless
Hellen was wondering that he should thus have been
let alone, Partlan began to play upon him a spray that
caused him to sink back benumbed, though still maintaining
hold of his sister.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Partlan gave the word, and the chariot went on
through the court to a side portico of the temple extension.
Here Æole was taken from Hellen’s arms, and
given over to several handmaids. And Hellen, who had
partially retained consciousness, swooned.</p>

<p class='c011'>When Hellen revived, he found himself lying upon a
couch in a room through whose one aperture the sunset
light was streaming. He raised to look about him; and,
at once, his eyes fastened upon a high grating at the
farthest end. Upon hearing a clicking behind him, he
turned, but saw nothing. Again he looked toward the
grating, to become horrified at perceiving behind it a
tall, imposing, red-garbed, masked figure. Stonily, Hellen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>returned the gaze of this worse than specter, his dread
augmenting because of the dizziness overcoming him.
It was something of relief when the figure, in lowest tone,
spoke.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Youth, thou art to bend, to obey. Wouldst thou
bring evil upon thy sister and thyself? Is it thy will to
see thy sister upon the altar? The high priest hath said
she will be gift, or handmaid.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Better the gift upon the altar,” spoke Hellen as he
strove to overcome his weakness, and arise.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Shouldst thou no longer chafe, thy sister will but be
a handmaid. This I promise thee.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who art thou that art so able to promise?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou hast heard of the ‘Silent Priest’?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have, and I have seen him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I speak for him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then he hath brought this upon us. And thou art
his base helper, his tool!”</p>

<p class='c011'>With regained strength, Hellen leaped from the
couch, and darted toward the grating, his hands outstretched,
menacing.</p>

<p class='c011'>But, as he reached it, he was overborne by a sweet,
subtle force. A tenderness exquisite pervaded him, so
that his threatening hands fell limp, and he stood motionless,
eagerly gazing.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My son,” pathetic, persuasive were the tones, “if
thou wilt but wait, a way will open for thee and thy sister
out of this bondage. This is but the step toward
thy home. Dost thou not feel that I speak truth?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do, I do.” Hellen was mastered.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then chafe no longer, but wait for the light.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>The figure then looked over, and beyond Hellen, and
said with authority:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Lead this youth to the chief priest.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Hellen turned sharply to behold close behind him a
weird, unnatural shape, closely habited in dust color.
How had it come almost within touch without noise or
rustle? And how of a serpent did it remind him as it
stood tall, slender, vibrating, and observing him with
brilliant, piercing eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>The red-garbed figure waved his hand in farewell to
Hellen, saying:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Follow him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Hellen, as if charmed, went after the noiseless, gliding,
quivering shape, through an opening door, and down a
wide passage to a great apartment to the north of the
temple proper. This was the gathering room of the
priests, and several of these stood about the door.</p>

<p class='c011'>When fairly within this apartment, Hellen’s listlessness
fled. He had caught sight of Æole at the farther end.
She was standing before the chief priest Urgis, who was
seated at a table; and by her side, and half supporting
her, was a maiden apparently as young as herself.</p>

<p class='c011'>In his eagerness, Hellen hurried past his dust-colored
guide, and paused almost beside Æole. With strange
intensity, he took in her grace, and the subtle charm of
expression pervading face, hands, and limbs,—each as
potent as her magnetic glance. Æole’s soul fascinated
in repose, in activity—in turn of the head, curves of the
limbs, shaping of foot, movement of hands,—in voice,
smile, buoyancy of tread. It was as though the material
body gladly served as glass the most transparent to disclose
the spiritual body within, in all its purity, beauty,
and perfectness of organization.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>But, as Hellen gazed and wondered, he became aware
of the power of a pair of eyes of rare beauty and intelligence.
These were set in the head of the maiden supporting
Æole, and so magnetic were they that his careless
look became fixed, whereat she blushed, and turned
the eyes away. He was quick to observe that hers was
a type of feature not purely Atlantean, a type similar to
Queen Atlana’s in its large brown eyes, rich olive complexion,
and fine, dark, waving hair. Who was this
bright, beautiful, imperial young creature? To his surprise,
conjectures about her began to rival his anxiety
for Æole; though not for long. For Priest Urgis, with
due solemnity, was addressing the newcomers.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Maidens, we of the temple greet thee. And hearken
ye well, Electra of Khemi, Æole of Pelasgia, and to this:
It is the will of the gods that, from this day, the great
temple holdeth you. For this honor, cease not to give
thanks. For this high place, call forth thy powers.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But, Cousin Urgis!” remonstrated Electra, proudly,
and to the amaze of the gathering priests. Never before
had incipient handmaid lifted her voice thus.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hush, daughter,” interrupted Urgis, his unctuous,
hypocritical tone vanishing. “Not here canst thou
speak unless bidden. Thou art to hearken, and to this.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Electra turned from him with such royal indifference
as to amaze the beholders the more. But Urgis, unheeding,
continued:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou, Electra of Khemi, daughter of the princes of
Atlantis and Khemi, and owner of many arts gained in
the palace of the high priest, art deemed most worthy
this honor. Much have we heard of thy fond care of the
mother passed away, and of the high, bright powers of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>thy mind. Thus hath it been thought fitting to call thee
to the service of our Father Poseidon. Then greeting
to thee, Princess Electra, and worthy Cousin.”</p>

<p class='c011'>At this mention of her mother, the tears came into
Electra’s eyes, and, in spite of herself, dashed down upon
her robe. But her spirit being brave, she was endeavoring
to compose herself to answer, when Urgis continued:</p>

<p class='c011'>“And thou, Æole of Pelasgia, hast been so long with
our gracious queen that we know thou wilt do well in
all that will be asked of thee. Much have we heard of
thy gentle ways, thy warm heart, thy quick mind, thy
zeal—gifts of value in a handmaid. Then greeting to
thee, Æole of Pelasgia.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Profound was the quiet when Urgis ceased. Indeed,
all were waiting for speech of Electra, whose tears were
drying. After pausing in impressive manner for a few
seconds, Urgis concluded:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sensel, it is for thee to lead these handmaids to their
rooms. There let them be served with food. In the
morning will their duties begin.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then spoke Electra in low, sweet tones that thrilled.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Priest, Cousin Urgis, to thy words of greeting I
hearken not. Happy was I in the palace of my Uncle
Oltis. Why force me hither? Why tear me from my
duties, the dear presence of my cousins? And—I am a
princess of Khemi and Atlantis.” Haughtily she regarded
him. “It is not a high place. No princess hath ever
served in a temple. Cousin Urgis, be just—have
mercy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Electra of Khemi, it cometh of more light. In the
coming time, princesses, like those of less place, may
look to be called as handmaids.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“By what right, Cousin Urgis?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>“To the High Priest it hath been given of the gods.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oltis—given of the gods!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The contempt of her tone astounded even Urgis.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Tell Oltis that I believe it not. Tell him I will not
yield. Tell him I will lift my voice until I arouse this
sluggish Atlantis!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Hellen’s heart beat wildly. What strength was hers
thus to speak. Besides, how rich and soft was her
voice with all its agitation. How exalted her look!</p>

<p class='c011'>She resumed more calmly, and in most loving tone:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now, Cousin Urgis, I will withdraw to the palace,
and take with me this maiden.” And she looked at Æole
reassuringly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Never! Here wilt thou stay. And speak not again,
else worse will come upon thee.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She took Æole’s hand, and whispered: “Speak for
thyself.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Æole glanced upward at the frowning Urgis. The
look was of such effect that he said gently:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is it thy will to speak, Æole of Pelasgia?”</p>

<p class='c011'>To Hellen’s astonishment, she implored, in tones
almost as firm as Electra’s:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Priest Urgis—with Electra—I ask, Why force me
hither? For I, too, was happy—quite happy with Queen
Atlana. Further, I have a brother; from him part me
not. For we are strangers, captives—and sorrow much
for Pelasgia. Yet are we ever able to cheer each other.
I need him; he needeth me. Priest Urgis, I beseech thee,
let me go to my brother!”</p>

<p class='c011'>So heartrending was her tone that Hellen could
endure no further. Thus he cried:</p>

<p class='c011'>“But—here is thy brother, Æole—thy brother who
hath not power to save thee!”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>He extended his arms as she turned, bewildered.
Upon perceiving his suffering expression, she uttered a
cry that brought more tears to Electra’s eyes, and sprang
to embrace him.</p>

<p class='c011'>Priest Urgis, enraged, arose, and ordered the pair to
separate. At the same moment King Atlano entered.
There was a falling back, a dread hush, as the king’s
eyes fastened upon the pathetic tableau. Scowling,
until his face grew black, he advanced menacingly
toward the unhappy brother and sister.</p>

<p class='c011'>But he was impeded. Someone had caught at his
robe. He turned to perceive it was Electra.</p>

<p class='c011'>“King Atlano, in the name of our Father Poseidon, I
ask that Æole and myself may go from this place.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Electra, ask naught in the name of Poseidon that is
not his will. By his wish thou art here. Thou hast
but to obey.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Never hath a princess been pressed into the temple.
I shall call to the queen, to the rulers.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thinkest thou any call of thine will reach them?
Thou wilt be too well watched. It is the will of thine
uncle thou art here; therefore, yield to it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou saidst it was by wish of Poseidon a moment
since.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It might be truly said that the listeners held their
breaths. Even Atlano’s was suspended for some seconds.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Electra, the wish of Poseidon is the will of thine
uncle.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou answerest with cunning; but tell me, is Oltis
ever thus ready to obey the higher powers? Is not
this a strange humility? Is there naught behind?”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>Here a thought presented itself. “I believe not that the
higher powers are in this. It is further false speech—another
shield for the working of evil by Oltis. And I
know his will, his wish. He hath an eye for my riches.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Atlano was confounded, but only for the moment.
He made the movement as if to withdraw from her
detaining hand. But she held on firmly, and continued:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yea, his will, his wish, is my riches. Bear to him
the word to take all, if he will but leave me free. I speak
for Æole, likewise.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The king at this was more than confounded. His
face paled, then flushed, and the words would not come.
After a terrifying pause, he said in a tone subdued, conciliatory:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Electra, another word, and thou wilt know sorrow.
Mock not the will of Poseidon.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She relinquished her hold on his robe, and fell on her
knees to implore:</p>

<p class='c011'>“O Poseidon, our father, our god, I ask this of thee:
Is it thy will that I am here—that these wishes of king
and priests shall have weight? Grant some sign, either
of yea or nay. Is it thy will, or is it not thy will?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Stricken with awe, king and priests listened to this
first, bold appeal to Poseidon that had ever been made
within the temple by aught save the initiated. And a
fearful quiet succeeded. Unconsciously, each was expecting
an answer. And it came. Far up, near the top of
the high vaulted ceiling, a low, soft voice dropped the
words:</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is—not.”</p>

<p class='c011'>They stared dumbly upward, awaiting more. In a
few seconds, was added:</p>

<p class='c011'>“But—out of this—will good work.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>The three unhappy ones took in a little hope. The
priests appeared less terrified. Atlano, recovering, looked
about in triumph, before deriding:</p>

<p class='c011'>“That was a weak voice for a god. I thought the
gods thundered when they spoke to men. Electra
wilt thou try again?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Electra shuddered. She felt it was blasphemy.</p>

<p class='c011'>Atlano subjoined, “It is time to end this. Where is
Sensel?”</p>

<p class='c011'>From the door glided in the dust-colored shape.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sensel, lead these handmaids to their rooms.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“King Atlano!” ejaculated Hellen.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha—Hellen!—What wouldst thou? Pardon for thy
wrongdoing of this morning?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nay. Do with me for that as thou wilt, but tear not
Æole from me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is ordered that ye shall part, not to meet.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mercy!” besought poor Hellen, looking upward.</p>

<p class='c011'>Upon them was again falling the voice, and firmer,
louder:</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is not ordered that the brother and sister shall
thus part. With every sun, will they meet.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Appalling was the hush. In spite of himself, the
king showed a mighty fear. He looked stealthily about
him to see every face blanched. Indeed, their hearts
felt blanched. Upward they gazed in voiceless horror,
each as if intent upon finding some crevice, or flaw in the
ceiling, that might explain the mysterious tones. But
this was a stone ceiling, well cemented. Vain could be
the most searching glances. Besides, the twilight was
creeping on.</p>

<p class='c011'>Protracted was the silence, until the king said, as if
against his will:</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>“Hellen, it may be that thyself and Æole can meet
each day. I shall speak with the high priest.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“King Atlano, wilt thou grant us Electra?”</p>

<p class='c011'>A glad light came into Electra’s eyes. This Atlano
perceived.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hellen, thou askest too much. Electra cannot join
you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Electra will join the brother and sister.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The voice was now faint, and far away. It seemed as
if it came rather from above than beneath the ceiling.
Some of the priests were so overcome as to fall on their
knees abjectly. With uncertain voice, Atlano called to
Sensel, who had again retired to the doorway:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sensel, lead these new handmaids to their building,
and let them be served with food. In the morning, will
their duties begin.”</p>

<p class='c011'>With one dread look at Hellen, Æole turned to comply.
But Hellen seized and embraced her, and held
tight Electra’s proffered hand. Thus they stood, until
Sensel said, softly:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Æole drew away from her brother’s arms,
walking as if faint. Electra, with a proud air, went
after her, and took her hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>When they had passed out, the king said to the dazed
Hellen:</p>

<p class='c011'>“For thee, thou wilt go to the palace. In the morning,
come hither for thy duty. But think not, I shall
forget thy wrongdoing. Go!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Hellen, following an attendant, tottered out.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VII.<br /> <span class='large'>THE TEMPLE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Æole and Electra followed the quivering Sensel into
the passage, thence to its end, and through a door leading
into a court about which was ranged the building
allotted to the handmaids.</p>

<p class='c011'>In this building, they ate and slept. As to recreation,
there was time for none, rest being their one desire when
relieved from duty; and thus there was no comradeship
among them. They were virtually as cut off from each
other as from their friends without.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sensel conducted the newcomers to rooms that adjoined,
and received their most grateful looks, though
he shook his head as if to disclaim thanks. As he was
about to leave them, he said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“In a little while, will I send you food and drink.”</p>

<p class='c011'>They thanked him, this time in words; and looked
after him until he had disappeared, when Electra whispered:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Didst thou note his kind voice, the gentle look of
those shining eyes? I believe him to be good—for all.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Electra, I like him; I am sure he is good.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, thou art growing as the rose over it!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Let us look at our rooms, Electra.”</p>

<p class='c011'>These, they found, were good sized and well lighted.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>Rugs covered the smooth floors, and soft were the
couches, easy the chairs. Besides, there was a table for
each. The apertures had hangings of white linen, full
and long, and an air of neatness prevailed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Æole sighed, but said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“We shall have some cheer, Electra.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is fair for a prison, Æole.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Æole stepped to her aperture to look out. Then
she went into Electra’s room, and inspected her view.
When this was done, she said, with effort:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Electra, wilt thou change rooms with me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yea. But why?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“From my room I can see the water; the sight causeth
pain. Thou knowest it leadeth to my home.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Her voice failed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou dear, sorrowing Æole!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Electra took her in her arms and held her tight, and
kissed her again and again.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am glad that my room will do—that those great
trees hide that mocking water. Thou poor dear!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Electra, thou givest cheer. I should not grieve
with thee to brighten.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Fondly she returned the embrace and kisses. Tears
were springing in both pairs of eyes when a low tap was
heard at the door.</p>

<p class='c011'>Electra answered to admit Sensel. He, himself, was
bearing the food and drink—thin cakes made of corn
and honey, pomegranates, melons, and a sherbet of almonds
and honey.</p>

<p class='c011'>As he set these upon the table, he apologized:</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was not my will to let another bear them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It pleaseth us; doth it not, Electra?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>“Of a truth it pleaseth. Sensel, I own I am hungry
in spite of this prison.” It was good to see her smile.</p>

<p class='c011'>Æole smiled back, as she said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“One cannot stay in the depths where thou art, Electra.
It giveth a fine hunger to look at thee.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Sensel laughed charmingly, then bowing low, retired.
At once they sat down, and with all their woe, did justice
to the dainty fare.</p>

<p class='c011'>When Sensel returned, they were sitting side by side,
deep in conversation. He said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ye see I come again. Have ye ended?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Each smiled her <i>yes</i>—and such smiles! A dotard’s
head would have been turned. No wonder was it that
his own smile answered, that his olive skin grew rosy,
that his beautiful eyes became even more brilliant, that
his tall body undulated with a grace surprising, that he
almost forgot what he had come for. However, Electra’s
words somewhat restored him. She said, with feeling:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sensel, well hast thou treated us. Thou hast
brought us what we like. Our thanks are thine.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He laughed so that they laughed to hear him; afterward,
he looked at Æole, his color rising. Thus she
said with fine graciousness:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sensel, our rest this night will be calmer that thou
hast served us.” And with this began to blush as Psyche
might because of his gallant bow.</p>

<p class='c011'>After the like attention to Electra, he thought of his
dishes, and withdrew with the air of a prince.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He is a wonder,” ejaculated Electra.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yea; and one it will be hard to get over. Was
there ever such grace as his in the bowing?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Never! His serpent self knoweth how to do things.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>Then, fearing he might have heard this, Electra arose,
and looked out with due caution. She returned, whispering:</p>

<p class='c011'>“He standeth in deep thought at the end of the passage,
and without the dishes or food. He hath passed
his burden to some other. I have it! He would know
more of us.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well is it, for we would know more of him.” And
Æole arose to peer out. “He hath gone,” next came
regretfully. “We shall not look upon him further this
day.”</p>

<p class='c011'>They resumed their seats, again to confide their fears,
or to remain quiet and muse. Upon parting for the
night, they wept in each other’s arms.</p>

<p class='c011'>But they were young. Thus sleep wooed them from
their sorrow, and they aroused only when the gong had
sounded long in the morning. When Sensel came to
conduct them to breakfast, they looked refreshed; and, if
it must be told, sped rather buoyantly to the eating
room.</p>

<p class='c011'>Here they found about twenty of the handmaids.
These were walking up and down, awaiting the serving
of the meal. All were pretty and graceful. Indeed, a
few were beautiful. Their complexions varied from olive
to red, their eyes were either gray, brown, or black; and
the hair ranged from light brown to jet black. Thus,
all looked curiously at Æole because of her auburn
hair, blue eyes, and fair skin.</p>

<p class='c011'>Without exception, their expressions were sweet and
intelligent; and they responded with warmth when introduced
to the newcomers. After a short talk, all sat
down to the simple meal of pease, milk, bread, and fruit—Sensel,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>meanwhile, leaving them, until the meal should
be ended.</p>

<p class='c011'>When he returned, it was to bid the new handmaids
follow him. This they did, passing from the eating
room into the court, and thence to the passage they had
been in the night before. Through its length they went,
and paused at a great arched door at the end. Then
Electra whispered:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Æole, look within.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This door opened into the temple proper. Thus Æole,
who had never attended the services because the queen
did not, exclaimed of her exceeding wonder and admiration.
For this is what she saw:</p>

<p class='c011'>A great circular space, marble paved, and inclosed by
walls and ceiling resplendent in settings of gold, silver,
and orichalcum; at the eastern end, a richly engraved
golden altar on which the sacred fire blazed high, and
above which the morning light streamed in through a wide
aperture; a row of handmaids and one priest standing by
who had been in attendance the night through; flowers,
flowers everywhere, on altar, statues, in niches, and the
apertures; numbers of lamps of silver and gold pendent
from the ceiling by silver chains or supported by alabaster
stands—each lamp simulating a bird or flower, and all
having a handle at one end and a beak at the other for
pouring in oil, while through their upper surfaces projected
wicks from the reservoirs below; great stands of
alabaster bearing golden vessels in which smoked the incense;—and,
wonder of wonders, the many golden statues!</p>

<p class='c011'>After entering, Sensel led them among these golden
statues—these representatives of Poseidon, Cleito, and
the Nereids. Poseidon in his chariot, and with head
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>reaching to the roof, was a piece of work so stupendous
that Æole gazed bewildered, awed, until Sensel mercifully
set her to counting the Nereids disporting about
him on their dolphins.</p>

<p class='c011'>But this was like making way through a labyrinth to
the dazed Æole; and she found no rest until her eyes
lighted on the beauteous Cleito, who was standing in her
sweet serenity beside Poseidon. With a happy cry, she
darted toward the entrancing figure, put her arms about
it, and looked up with love into the tender face.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Electra, thus looked my mother. It is herself in
gold. My mother—my mother!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She was the wife of Poseidon. It is Cleito. Hast
thou not heard the story? How, in the ages past, Poseidon
came unto this island to find it a wilderness with her
for its one fair flower? How he wedded her, and made
of this a heaven almost? How ten sons were born to
them in the palace which is now the temple above?
How, when she died, he could no longer be king for
grief? How he placed the crown upon his eldest, Atlas?
How, after fond last words, he speeded away nevermore
to be seen of the islanders, whose heavy hearts at last
found cheer in the thought that their father was a god,
and had gone back to his heaven from there to watch
over and guide them?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have heard it all from Queen Atlana. How dear is
the story. Ah, Electra, if she were like this, what have
we to fear?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The tears were in Electra’s eyes. And Sensel’s, could
it be that his were moist? Eager were his low tones.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Fear not, Æole. The spirit of Cleito may not be
able to aid thee, but the gods have other workers.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>Then, perceiving that the priest was nearing them, he
added in his ordinary tone:</p>

<p class='c011'>“We may linger among these no longer. Thy duties,
and those of Electra, are now for thy thought. This
priest will show you all.”</p>

<p class='c011'>To this priest they were then introduced, and he at once
began to initiate them in their duties. These were to
dust, to arrange the flowers, to fill and light the lamps,
to watch the sacred fire, and to assist in the chanting of
the services. Thus entered they upon their servitude.</p>

<p class='c011'>Through the day, the two looked forward to the night.
Would Hellen be permitted to join them, in deference to
the voice, or would the king be overruled? Their anxiety
grew as the day waned; and, when dismissed late in
the evening, they repaired to their rooms without hope.
When ready for supper, and about to emerge from their
doors, Sensel was perceived standing near. At their
greeting, he came towards them smiling his brightest,
and said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hellen doth wait for you on the hill above, near the
temple of Poseidon and Cleito. There ye may talk with
him for an hour, when ye have ended your meal.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is good,” returned Æole, overjoyed. “Sensel, we
thank thee. To think the king doth grant it. We feared
to hope.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yea, the king granteth it. But—let there be care,”
and turning quickly, he glided off.</p>

<p class='c011'>After a hurried meal, they came out into the court to
find him awaiting them. He led them to a low door
towards the west, and opening this disclosed the hillside.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou wilt find him above,” he whispered, “and have
a care. Well is it the moon riseth.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>They hastened out, and upward to meet Hellen just
below the gold inclosed temple. Much time did he take
in embracing Æole, the while holding Electra’s hand.
When his ardor could no longer be prolonged, he said in
lowest tone:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have found the spot for us. It is the watch tower
on the northern slope. There can no ear hearken.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He then took the lead. When passing the sacred temple,
Electra forgot not to fall on her knees in devotion to
Poseidon and Cleito, and afterward besought their intercession.
Her face was the brighter when she arose.</p>

<p class='c011'>This watch tower stood below the temple of Poseidon
and Cleito, and above the inclosures holding the sacred
bulls that were roaming in their grounds with much of
bellowing. This bellowing was indeed a safeguard, as it
could but drown all sounds contiguous.</p>

<p class='c011'>The round tower must have been fifty feet in height,
stone steps leading up to its doorway which was fifteen
feet from the ground. At the base, the interior was
about seventy-five feet in diameter, the wall here being
fifteen feet in thickness, this thickness decreasing gradually
upward, until at the top it was but eight feet.</p>

<p class='c011'>When inside, Hellen assisted each up the stone staircase.
At the top, they seated themselves on the broad
ledge; and when the bulls grew rampant of noise, Hellen
explained:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ere night fell, the king sent me word that we could
meet here on this part of the mountain for an hour of each
evening, until it is his will to change. But I think he
recked not of the bulls.”</p>

<p class='c011'>They laughed. Then Æole asked: “Who brought
thee the word?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>“Sensel!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Say not his name in such tone,” urged Electra. “He
hath been very good to us.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“His serpent self, then. I believe he is half serpent.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is because of his dress, and his manner of moving
and speeding,” interposed Æole. “But his voice is fine
and rich in kind tones, and his eyes speak good. Though
let us not talk of him now. Tell us of the queen.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She hath been sick through the day. None have seen
her save the ladies Rica and Elna. They are in sore
trouble. Ah, how my blood doth heat!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of a truth thou lookest in a fever,” said Electra.
“But calm thyself, for the air surgeth much about us.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He smiled. Electra continued:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, the poor queen! How fond is her heart; yet
she hath but a stone in the king!”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was Hellen’s turn. “Electra, thou speakest to be
heard—in thy warmth. We must have a care. The air
surgeth, and in it there are ears. Thus it is wise to keep
cool, and speak low.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Good was it to hear Electra laugh.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, Hellen, but thou hast the last. Though for this
time—alone.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Here Æole, who had been far off in her abstraction,
asked:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hellen, thinkest thou the queen will see thee on the
morrow?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is my hope.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Bid her take cheer. Tell her my duties are light,
that my room is next to that of my sister Electra. Tell
her my fond thoughts are hers, that I live on my hope to
get to her.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>“I will.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And give her my fond greeting,” spoke Electra.
“She was the friend of my mother, and I saw her much
until these last years.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Electra, why did we never meet thee before?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Queen Atlana and mine Uncle Oltis have not been
friends since my grandfather Olto died. The queen doth
think my grandfather was hastened to his death through
the lack of care of Oltis.” Her voice had sunk to a
whisper, and she looked cautiously about her. “That
is why the queen never cometh to the temple. That is
why I have been kept from her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oltis is a blight on all that is good,” responded Hellen.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yea, and he doth master the king. It is no wonder
that the queen doth shun him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then followed quiet, the quiet of despair, almost. The
three looked sadly down from their eyry upon the scene
beneath—upon the zones of water<a id='r17'></a><a href='#f17' class='c012'><sup>[17]</sup></a> with their boats and
galleys; upon the zones of land<a href='#f17' class='c012'><sup>[17]</sup></a> with their guardhouses
and race courses; upon the plain to the west with its
many streams, its pyramids, its denseness of verdure, its
brightly lighted habitations; upon the restless bulls in
their inclosures; upon the dwellings of the artificers,
miners and husbandmen that spread northward beyond
the third zone of water; upon the mountains towering to
the northeast; upon the ocean to the east. At length
Æole spoke.</p>

<p class='c011'>“This is a most smiling spot. Why are not the people
better?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>“They lack thought for gods and man,” answered
Electra.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yet—they show faith in worship.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is the letter not the spirit. Theirs is a weak faith;
their only feeling a warm one for self.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yea, they are sunk in thought of self, and thus in
the placing high of self,” added Hellen.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is too true. Atlano and Oltis would be gods.
They would scale heaven—there to be waited upon by
even Amen and Poseidon. Ah, what a spirit of evil hath
mine uncle—he brother of my mother!” Poor Electra
turned away that they might not see her emotion.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Æole, Electra, I call to mind that, in Pelasgia, we
were taught to put away self, to seek the truth. Æole,
I often heard our father say: ‘It is much to win a battle,
more to do a kind act.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, Hellen, Hellen! Of late, I dream much of our
father. But last night, he came to me in sleep, and
whispered, ‘Æole, all will be well. Have hope.’ Thinkest
thou it was his spirit talking to mine? Is it that in
sleep our spirits so throw off the bonds of flesh as to have
full being? Is it that they can see, can hold sweet speech
with those beyond? Yea, it is, it is! I know that our
father is not of earth—that he cometh to me in spirit.
And our mother? If he hath gone, she hath not staid.
They look on us from above.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Æole, wouldst thou rave? Dost thou think the
above, a place of torment?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hellen!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Could they look upon us would they joy?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They could see beyond this.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is well thou canst hold such a thought—better if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>thou canst believe such—best of all, if thou wouldst have
them dead. But I doubt them. Often I think what if
they live to forget us. The horror of it!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The horror is in such a thought, Hellen. Wouldst
thou sin?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Æole, it is they who sin, thus to forget their children.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hellen,” cried Electra, “thou hast shocked Æole.
Look how white she is.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Indeed Æole was not only white, but quivering of her
wounded love and indignation, and she turned her head
away when Hellen, of his contrition, begged for her forgiveness.
A miserable quiet fell upon the three until
Electra said below her breath:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Someone cometh down the mountain side.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is that shaking Sensel!” exclaimed Hellen.</p>

<p class='c011'>They remained still until the figure came beneath
them, and proved to be Sensel. He called softly:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Are ye above?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Electra answered: “Yea.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He returned: “It is past the hour. Thyself and
Æole should be in the temple.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We will come at once, Sensel,” spoke Æole, firmly.</p>

<p class='c011'>This, her firmness, was the result of Hellen’s rebellious
expression. Thereupon, she made the movement to
descend, but Hellen heeded it not. Then she called:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sensel, wilt thou come up?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Never!” cried Hellen. Starting to his feet, he held
out his hand, and led her half way down, there to meet
Sensel, who had been quick to respond.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hellen, thou wilt go back for Electra,” said she. “I
will go the rest of the way with Sensel.” Then quickly
drawing her hand from his, she gave it to Sensel, and
down they went.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>Hellen returned for Electra. When without, they
beheld the other pair already far up the hill. The discomfited
Hellen could only mutter, as he began to lead
Electra:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I merit this. But never have I seen Æole thus.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dost thou think thou canst ever know a woman,
Hellen?” was the unsatisfactory return.</p>

<p class='c011'>In unbroken silence, they continued their way. When
the advancing pair were joined at the hillside door,
Hellen put his arm about Æole, and kissed her good-night,
afterward whispering, “I was wrong.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But I have not been right.”</p>

<p class='c011'>With this, she kissed him again and again, so that he
was comforted. When he had well pressed Electra’s
hand, off he sped.</p>

<p class='c011'>The next two nights, Hellen bore no better tidings of
the queen. She still continued too feeble to see any but
her ladies, therefore the three young hearts grew in sadness.</p>

<p class='c011'>But, on the fourth day, he received the message by
Azu that the queen would speak with him; and, overjoyed,
followed the smiling pygmy to the bower room,
there to meet the Lady Rica who conducted him to an
inner room. Here, on a couch, lay Atlana; and, as he
approached, his joy became dread, so great was the
change in her. Listlessly she held out her hand, which
the affectionate youth fell on his knees to kiss, while the
heavy sighs came fast. When Rica had withdrawn,
Atlana murmured:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hellen, be not cast down. I am better, though weak,
weak. Tell me, how is Æole?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dear Queen, Æole is well in body, but sore in mind
because of thee. She hath not smiled for days.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>“My poor Æole.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But for Electra she could not have borne it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Electra!” In spite of her weakness the queen half
arose to stare at him in doubt and terror.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yea, Electra. She is a handmaid, and was called
with Æole.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Electra a handmaid! She is a princess—is of our
blood. Hellen, thou art wrong.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dear Queen, Electra, the niece of Oltis, is she that I
mean—a maiden most fair, most bright. There could be
but one Electra with such eyes, such a smile, such a
grand spirit. To look upon her is to fall at her feet.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The queen lay back and moaned: “Electra it is—it
is.” Then clasping her hands she implored: “O Poseidon,
is this the next? And canst thou look on? O
Amen, hast thou no shafts of fire?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Hellen was awestricken at the intense despair of her
tone, the reproach even.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dear, dear Queen, be not so wrought. Thou wilt
die.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nay, Hellen.” To his amazement, she again half
arose. “Nay, I shall not die. I will live—live to bring
to naught these fiends—these monsters of false dealing.
Yet, ah, Atlano, Atlano!” She began to weep in a way
that rent him.</p>

<p class='c011'>After a little, with the hope to divert her, he said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Electra hath told us of thy fond feeling for her
mother.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yea. We were most dear to each other. The
horror of it, the crime, that Electra hath been called to
the temple!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Queen Atlana, why is it a crime?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>“Hellen, I will tell thee.” She looked about her in
fear, before whispering:</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is—that, at times, the handmaids have been called to
the inner holy place, where only the highest priests and
the king can serve. And—these handmaids never have
been heard of more. Never hath one been seen after
passing into the inner holy place.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Alas for poor Hellen! He could only break away and
utter cry after cry of dismay until speech came.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What can I do? What can I do? Ah, why have I
not known this?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is wise for these Atlanteans, in their lack of spirit,
to be quiet, Hellen. But, hearken.” Her tone was calm
with all its anguish. Insensibly, he also calmed, and
again knelt beside her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I must tell thee—these handmaids who have thus
vanished were the fairest of their sisters. Thus do I fear
for Æole and Electra.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Hellen, groaning, sank prostrate, unnerved.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thinkest thou, Hellen, they were yielded on the altar,
the gifts of a wicked worship? Or what else thinkest
thou? What thoughts have been mine since the first
lovely young girl was taken from the others. And I have
had from Atlano but laughter, mockery, when I have
questioned.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Queen Atlana, thou hast rent me!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Hellen had arisen to pace wildly: and then stopped,
and fell to considering after the manner of one demented.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hellen, it will not do to give way as if mad. Rather,
case thyself in rock. Thou shouldst be serpent and dove,
wouldst thou help Æole and Electra.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Easy it is to talk thus!” He paused, choked for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>moment. “But—what can I do? How can I help them?
Oh, ye base Pelasgians, to leave us to this fate! I would
wish to be born of stones, iron—not of such flesh and
blood!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hellen, thou art going mad, thus to charge thy parents,
and such parents! Call to mind that thou hast told
me of their truth, their care. Nay—thou art not going
mad—thou art mad. Yea, demons hold thee. Leave
me, Hellen!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The queen’s indignation would have overwhelmed any
save this fiery, reckless, despairing youth. He was too
far gone to be reached by reproach of any kind. Thus,
he turned away, saying:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou hast said it, Queen Atlana. I will leave thee.
My own bitter thoughts are more dear than the cheer
thou givest. But with thee I leave my fond wishes, for
thou hast been father, mother in one, the gods bless
thee!”</p>

<p class='c011'>With this he began to hasten away.</p>

<p class='c011'>The queen watched him in anguish. He must not
leave with such a sore spirit. When he was even at the
door, she murmured:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hellen, one more word.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Queen Atlana, thou hast given me too many.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Though he had paused and turned full around.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am sure all will go well, if thou wilt wait and be
calm.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Have we not waited—years? And this is what they
bring.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It may be the first step to your home.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Hellen walked toward her with eager face. “That
calleth to my mind this,” he said.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>Then he related what had occurred between himself
and the red-garbed figure, and dwelt upon the intervention
of the mysterious voice. The queen acknowledged
the force of Electra’s reason for being dragged to the
temple by bending her head in shame; and raised it not
until he spoke of the voice. At the end, she was so awed
as to fall back overcome. Her lips then moved as if in
prayer, and Hellen distinguished:</p>

<p class='c011'>“O Amen—O Poseidon—ye have not forgotten, as I
feared.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She continued quiet for a little, her eyes closed. Then
she raised with sudden strength and brightening look.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hellen, hope. The gods answer. I feel it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Could I but feel it. Are there gods?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hellen, no more. Call to mind thy last sin. There
are limits.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Forgive me, dear Queen.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The king seeth the powers above are in this, or he
would not have yielded. He hath granted Æole and
thyself much.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Every night since have we met, and Electra hath been
with us each time.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dear Electra. Hellen, she is noble. Such care was
hers of her mother. She is true and fond.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do I not know it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then he blushed because of the queen’s keen look.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Think not too much of her, Hellen. It will but cause
thee further sorrow.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dear Queen Atlana, didst thou know her father?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yea. Cairais was a most noble prince of Khemi. He
came hither to visit, and learn of our land of Chimu.
Then it was that he met Lustra, the sister of Oltis. At
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>once were they drawn to each other; and soon were wedded,
and went to Khemi. They staid in Khemi several
years; and there was Electra born. But Lustra began to
fail, and pined for Atlantis. Cairais brought her back,
and she grew better. Then he sickened and passed
away before we thought him in danger. Lustra so
mourned that she again failed; and was not long in going
to him. Through her time of pain, the child Electra
showed a grand heart. She was a woman in thought
and help.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Have not Æole and I felt it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Her mother was good and most fair; her father, noble
of heart and mind. Electra, in truth, is their daughter.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But—dear Queen—why should the Atlanteans bear
as they do?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They have been changing fast since the rule of Oltis.
They are blind, lost to feeling, sunk in pleasure. When
some have risen in their anger they have been sore treated.
The father of the first handmaid that was called became
too questioning, too threatening. Therefore, he and his
family were banished to Chimu. After a few such cases,
the people yielded. Thou knowest even I was forced
to yield.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Whilst I clung to Æole, a drug was held at my nostrils
that made me, for the while, lose all sense. Their
arts are many.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I shall be crazed again!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Be calm, Hellen. Call to mind that the gods are
hearkening. My dreams long have boded some dire evil
to this island.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“May such come. May this island sink into these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>waters, and soon—to rid the world of such wicked
work!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hellen, thou knowest not what thou sayest. Yet,
thou dost but speak my dreams.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She covered her eyes with her hands, and tremor after
tremor passed over her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dear Queen Atlana, we will cease this talk so full of
horror. Let me kiss thy hand. Then will I go.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yea, Hellen. It were better thou shouldst leave me
for a little.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She held out her hands. He rubbed them gently,
magnetically, so that she became calmer, and soon lay
quiet. Then he arranged the cushions, and placed the
shawl over her most tenderly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dear Queen Atlana, mayest thou now slumber. I go
for a little.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My fond wishes to Æole and Electra. And bid them
hope.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will.”</p>

<p class='c011'>After kissing her hands he went from her. The ladies
Rica and Elna then came in and fanned her until sleep
came.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alas, poor Queen Atlana!</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VIII.<br /> <span class='large'>POSEIDON’S FESTIVAL DAY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>It was an hour past noon when Hellen left the palace.
Soon he was traversing the great roadway among throngs
of people, some on foot, some on horseback, some in
chariots; and all, like himself, bound for the great temple.</p>

<p class='c011'>For this was the Festival day of Poseidon, and he
must now be honored less from love than from habit.
So much had this people fallen.</p>

<p class='c011'>This great roadway was stupendous of construction.
Of thirty feet in width, it coiled about the mountain,
spiral-like, from the base to the summit fifteen hundred
feet above, in terraces of a hundred feet in height—these
terraces being interrupted only about the vast groundwork
of the temple, and there being continued in tunnels.
In many places the roadway was cut out of the solid rock;
and, in others, built over solid masonry in which the
arch was a conspicuous figure; whilst transverse paths
led from it up and down in numerous available points,
causing the mountain to be accessible in every part. In
this manner did the ancient Atlanteans testify their homage
for Poseidon and Cleito, whose temple surmounted
all—whose temple now was so seldom approached even
by those considering themselves the most devout.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>Along the roadway, with the throng, speeded Hellen
until he arrived at the wide transverse road that curved
upward to the Grove of Poseidon and through the grove
to the great court of the temple.</p>

<p class='c011'>This Grove of Poseidon, dense in its shade, was planted
in cypresses and palms that stood in groups of threes,
and about it were stationed columns of orichalcum inscribed
with the ancient laws, both civil and religious.
The largest of these columns stood in front of the gateway
of the great court, and of this more will be said
anon. Sufficient for the present is it to add that, as every
Atlantean passed it, he was supposed to bow in veneration.
Though of late years even this simple observance
was falling into almost utter neglect.</p>

<p class='c011'>Hellen entered the gateway to find the great court
quite filled with people. On he pressed to the main
portico—that vast portico about which were ranged the
golden statues of Poseidon’s ten sons and their wives.<a id='r18'></a><a href='#f18' class='c012'><sup>[18]</sup></a>
Here he paused, as did others, to admire the garlands
flung about these, as well as gaze upon the scene below,
of mountain with encircling zones of land and water, of
the beautiful Luith winding to the sea, of that sea spreading
blue and serene to the eastward. And Hellen
thought that never had a day been so fair, never had the
view been so enchanting.</p>

<p class='c011'>He passed through the portal, and into a spacious hall
whose stone ceiling was supported by columns of granite
and syenite. From this hall opened the great circular
temple proper, its wide portal facing the entering one; and
both looking to the east.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>Just within this sacred portal, Hellen took his stand so
as to face the great altar to the right. As the people
entered, they also turned to face both portal and altar,
and consequently the east. Of the four cardinal points,
the east was held in the most reverence, it being deemed
the especial abiding place of the gods.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the northern curve of the temple were three doors
that led to the temple extension. The one toward the
east opened into a passage leading to the inner holy place,
or sanctuary, and through it only the king, high priest,
chief priest, and the few priests highest in authority
could pass. The middle door admitted the inferior
priests from their gathering room. By the third door,
toward the west, the handmaids entered from the long
passage that extended northward to their own building.
On the left of this passage were the rooms reserved for
the priests and the few male attendants. On its right,
the first door opened into the great gathering room, and
farther along were other doors leading to rooms connecting
with this that were sacred to the priests. As the
rooms on the right of the passage, as well as the gathering
room, were inside rooms, they would have been dark
had not this part of the extension been run up higher,
thus admitting of apertures in the walls just below the
vaulted ceilings. To the right of this middle part, was
the inner sanctuary with its rear connecting rooms.
These were lighted by apertures; and those of the inner
sanctuary and the principal rooms overlooked the eastern
coast.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the great stone dais, holding the golden altar and
leading to the inner sanctuary, were gathered the priests,
chanting. Toward the portal were the minstrels with
lyre, syrinx, harp, pipes, cymbals, and drum. At intervals
these accompanied the priests, the people swelling
the refrains.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>
<img src='images/i_101.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>On a dais near the middle door, sat the king in his
robes of state, and about him on a lower dais were
seated the nobles and their wives. Grouped about the
statues of Poseidon and Cleito were the handmaids,
attired in long flowing robes of thin white linen and
garlanded with lilies. Each held a bunch of rarest flowers,
beside. A charming spectacle were they of youthful
grace and innocence. But the despairing Hellen, as he
gazed, could but shudder and grow faint at thought of
their probable fate.</p>

<p class='c011'>At first he could not distinguish Æole, nor Electra.
But erelong, he perceived them to the left of the statue
of Poseidon; and soon was brightening under a loving
look from the one and a smile from the other. Then, so
great became the pressure of the crowd, that he lost sight
of them, and thus turned his attention to the statues of
the Nereids nearest him. These, as well as the others,
were lavishly decorated with flowers conspicuous among
which were the blue lotus, chrysanthemum, anemone,
acacia blossom, convolvulus, water lily, rose, tuberose,
lilac, and the graceful plumes of the papyrus. Tall shoots
of the last, over ten feet in height, also adorned the apertures,
producing fine effect; whilst garlands and festoons
hung from every available point. Most elegantly did the
vast interior bear testimony to the Atlanteans’ skill in
flower culture.</p>

<p class='c011'>When the temple was full, and but few stragglers
arriving, the great silver gong was sounded before the
altar by a priest. Profound became the quiet. And,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>almost instantly, the door leading to the inner sanctuary
opened to admit the high priest, the chief priest, and the
few priests of superior rank.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of course, Oltis was the observed of all, not so much
because of his office, nor the fact of his officiating so
seldom, as that the people held an unconscious fear and
distrust of him. Every eye was fixed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now, as he moved with slow, stately step toward the
altar, a mighty shock came upon these quiescent islanders.
Oltis had dared to make another innovation upon
the ancient sacred customs! He had discarded the white
linen robe of the priests, the silver circlet with its sapphire,
and was resplendent in a purple woolen robe embroidered
in gold and a miter richly jeweled. Worse, he was wearing
these with an air indicating he would brook no interference.</p>

<p class='c011'>The great throng began to sway, and murmur; and
those that could, looked from Oltis to King Atlano, inquiringly,
resentfully.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Atlano was smiling back as response to the salutation
of the high priest, appearing to think it in order
that the priestly vestments should rival his own in color
and splendor. For Atlano wore the royal purple sacred
ever before to the king, and his high crown was no
richer in gems than the high priest’s miter.</p>

<p class='c011'>When the king showed no disapproval, the murmurs
of dissent grew louder, and even began to swell above the
anthem the priests were raising to the accompaniment of
the minstrels. But this anthem was long, and in honor
of Poseidon, and of such beauty that the dissenting ones
began to listen, charmed. When it ceased, the vast
assemblage had calmed.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>Then Oltis swept before the altar to chant with melodious
voice an invocation to Poseidon, the while heaping
upon it the fruits and flowers the people presented for
offering. When the altar could hold no more, he turned
and implored blessings from the gods in return for the
virtues of their monarch. He dwelt long upon the king’s
moderation, justice, self-command, generosity, love of
truth, freedom from covetousness and sensuality in so fulsome
a manner that Hellen writhed; and next caught
himself groaning as he wondered over the easy forbearance
of this listening people.</p>

<p class='c011'>When Oltis had finished, and was raising his head
proudly to survey the immense audience, Hellen took in
as never before his strong likeness to Atlano. Both
were tall, powerfully formed, strong featured, slightly receding
of forehead and chin, red of skin, and fiery-eyed.
But, in Oltis’ face was a look of dissimulation and craft
that repelled even more than Atlano’s sensual expression.
In a flash Hellen understood.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah,” thought he, “Oltis hath aims beyond this temple.
Can it be that he pandereth to Atlano with the view
to be king himself? That royal robe meaneth much!”</p>

<p class='c011'>While Oltis stood gazing at the people, and receiving
with unconcern their dissatisfied looks, a great stir was
heard in the entrance hall. As this increased, every eye
that could turned to the portal, to behold there entering—Queen
Atlana with her ladies, whilst Azu himself
held up her long purple train!</p>

<p class='c011'>At this most unusual appearance, the audience went
wild—smiling, waving their hands, bursting into enthusiastic
cries. The Atlanteans loved their queen, and her
long absence from worship had been wondered at and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>deplored. Her vacant chair had been a protest of which
they had not felt free to speak. But now all must be
right, as she was coming back. So they went wild of
their delight.</p>

<p class='c011'>The astonished king had arisen. Oltis stood fixed and
staring. Queen Atlana, crowned, clad in purple and
gold, and ablaze with jewels, slowly advanced—the people
joyfully giving way—until she had come nigh the
king. With her ladies’ assistance she mounted the few
steps of the dais; and sank into the chair she had been
wont to occupy at the side of the king, but which now
was placed toward the edge of the dais. Then her
ladies formed about her, and, following her example, bent
in prayer.</p>

<p class='c011'>Intense had grown the quiet. They were as spellbound,
waiting for the queen to raise her head. When
she did, it was to look toward the king. But his face
was averted. Then her glance was toward the priests.
Breathlessly watched the people. How would she accept
the high priest’s latest profanity?</p>

<p class='c011'>Her eye was quick to distinguish Oltis in his royal
robing. And she started violently. For this the people
were prepared. But the olden spirit of Atlantis stirred
within them, when, accepting to the full his intent, she
arose and stared at him, astounded!</p>

<p class='c011'>Despite himself, Oltis’ eyes fell beneath hers. This encouraged
the awakening islanders, who began to murmur
rebelliously, even to hiss. Yes, it had come to this—a
high priest of Atlantis was suffering indignity in the
temple, and from its worshipers!</p>

<p class='c011'>Shuddering, the queen again looked toward the king,
to meet his scornful smile. This smile the people beheld,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>and further, the grand manner in which the queen drew
herself up and questioned with her eloquent eyes. In
their appreciation, they burst forth into their favorite cry
of “All dear is Queen Atlana!” but at once hushed upon
perceiving the baleful looks the king was casting at her.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mute of their rage, they began to sway tumultuously,
vengefully: then made as if they would array themselves
about her as she tottered, and leaned upon the Lady
Rica. And the ensuing mutterings grew into imprecations.</p>

<p class='c011'>At this serious moment, diversion occurred. The door
leading to the inner sanctuary opened, admitting a figure
taller than any in that assemblage, and of such majesty
that the surging crowd quieted, and a few cried out in
awe:</p>

<p class='c011'>“The ‘Silent Priest’! The ‘Silent Priest’!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The ‘Silent Priest’ bowing in grand, yet benign manner,
advanced until almost beside Oltis; then, facing the
people, signed that the murmurings must cease, and the
ceremonies continue. Most graceful and significant were
his gestures: and even Atlano and Oltis followed them as
if charmed.</p>

<p class='c011'>As to Queen Atlana, her amazement was supreme.
Never had she seen this priest, though much had she
wondered over his mysterious advent upon the island,
and what such presence meant. Thus she stood transfixed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Rarely had the ‘Silent Priest’ appeared at the services.
Yet, among the people, it was already whispered that,
since his coming, things had changed for the better.
Fewer were the animal offerings, and no handmaids had
been forced into the inner sanctuary. Now it was plain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>that he exercised some subtle force not only upon the
subordinate priests, but even upon King Atlano and the
high priest as these were regarding him in reverence, in
subservience.</p>

<p class='c011'>When the king and queen were seated, the ‘Silent
Priest’ went before the altar, there to raise his eyes
and move his lips in prayer. But no sound came forth,
for the ‘Silent Priest’ was voiceless. But such were his
magnetism and expression that king, queen, priests and
people followed him in awe, and partly comprehending.</p>

<p class='c011'>When his prayer was finished, he went from the altar,
a little to one side, and stood absorbed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Oltis moved before the altar, and signed to the
handmaids. These began to sing in such fashion that
the people listened, enthralled. Soon they were gliding
about the statues of Poseidon and Cleito, and in and out
among the Nereids, still singing. To Hellen, knowing
what he did, it was unbearable to listen to the sweet
voices, and watch the graceful movements of these beautiful,
innocent, perhaps doomed young girls, each wearing
so charmingly her robe of filmy white, her garland
of purest lilies.</p>

<p class='c011'>As they moved about Poseidon, they threw in his
chariot their bunches of flowers, so that quickly he was
standing amid heaping floral tributes. And Cleito was not
neglected, for each took off the garland running from
shoulder to waist, to lay it about her, after stooping to
kiss her hand. And, oh, the grace of it all!</p>

<p class='c011'>Quite a while did this last, to the delight of the
beholders. After the handmaids had again resumed their
places, all grew grave, for the time had come when Oltis
was to deliver the speech eulogistic of Poseidon.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>He stood up high before them in front of the altar, and
his haughty tones rang out:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Gracious King, Gracious Queen, Priests, Nobles,
People: another year hath brought plenty upon Atlantis.
Another year have the gods smiled: another year have
they breathed into our minds their will. And, this day, as
a year since, yea, as thousands of years since, we meet to
joy in the festival of our Father Poseidon, and to plead
for his further favor. I, his high priest, though far from
worthy—”</p>

<p class='c011'>Here was most fearful interruption. From the statue
of Poseidon emanated a groan; and then it flung at Oltis
this.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why art thou far from worthy?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Oltis shrank back, mute, and gazed in horror at the
statue. The people, screaming in terror, fell against each
other. The king and queen started to their feet, and
stood rigid.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Oltis, with greatest effort, rallied. In loud, though
shaking tones, he continued:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I call myself far from worthy, because with the years
I the better know my failings, my evil turnings—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is thy new robe an evil turning?” was now spoken
abruptly by a powerful voice at the rear of the assemblage.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a simultaneous looking backward to discover
this speaker. Oltis stared in the same direction, paling
even to his lips. Fearful was the hush that followed.
At length, he desperately resumed:</p>

<p class='c011'>“On this day so promising—”</p>

<p class='c011'>But paused to gaze, petrified, at the people, who were
reflecting his stony horror.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>Far off, beneath the waters, was beginning a loud,
menacing rumbling! It was approaching the island!
On—on—it was coming—even to beneath their feet!
Was the sea pouring into the bowels of the earth?</p>

<p class='c011'>As they stood dazed, the massive walls began to shake
violently, threatening to fall inward—the accompaniment
to the earth now quivering fast beneath—that earth they
had deemed so solid, so stable!</p>

<p class='c011'>With the cry of panic, the islanders began to rush
upon each other, no purpose in their movements. Great
loss of life would have resulted had not the silver gong
sounded imperatively.</p>

<p class='c011'>The frantic people turned to see it held by the ‘Silent
Priest,’ who was still standing in his place with mien undaunted.
He returned their agonized looks by smiles;
then gesticulated that the worst was over. Indeed, the
earth was already quieting. Next, he pointed to Queen
Atlana, as if beseeching their consideration. They looked
to perceive her fainting in the arms of the Lady Rica.
Then they calmed.</p>

<p class='c011'>The oscillations had ceased. Atlano, haggard and
trembling, signed that the queen must be taken out.
Accordingly, she was placed in a chair and borne by
some of the nobles to her chariot, the people looking on
mute, motionless.</p>

<p class='c011'>But when she had been borne out, they began to
hasten after her, with no regard for the benediction Oltis
was endeavoring to mutter. When king and priests alone
remained, these, by one accord, speeded to their respective
passages, thence to escape into the air. Surely such
a convulsion must have direfully disfigured the face of
nature.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>But without, all was bright, serene, unchanged. Not
a stone had fallen. But—what did it mean? Never
within the island’s existence, had there been any evidence
of the earth’s instability. And it was Poseidon’s Festival
Day! Was there warning in this?</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IX.<br /> <span class='large'>THE ‘SILENT PRIEST.’</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>During the earthquake, Hellen had tried to force his
way to Æole and Electra in face of the panic-stricken
throng pressing toward the portal. He would have
been crushed had not the people quieted under the magnetism
of the ‘Silent Priest.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Æole and Electra were standing close to the statue of
Poseidon when the queen became prostrated because of
the king’s baleful looks. And they could not hope to
get beside her, so great was the surging of the people.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then appeared this ‘Silent Priest.’ From the first
glance, Æole had stood motionless, fascinated; and aroused
only when her companions began to sing and march.
During the evolutions, her eyes were continually turning
to him. When in her place again beside the statue, she
saw only him, heard not Oltis when he attempted his
speech. Then came the shock of the mysterious voice.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, Electra, it speaketh again,” she whispered: “It
is the voice of our friend.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yea, but not the voice of a friend to these Atlanteans.
Look at the queen!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Æole turned to perceive both king and queen gazing
stonily at the statue. She responded:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Electra, I fear for her. Let us get to her.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>Desperately they tried to make their way, but vain
was their puny strength. It was some relief when the
queen sat down; but again she arose when the voice came
from the rear; and was as marble until the earthquake
when she fell in Rica’s arms.</p>

<p class='c011'>Æole, of her dizziness, would have fallen also, had not
a strong arm upheld her, and a tender voice whispered:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Æole, strength. The worst is over.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was Sensel, and he was offering his other arm to
Electra; whilst about him were flocking the nearest handmaids,
as though he alone could save them.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was at this moment that Hellen succeeded in getting
sight of the two. Reaching an aperture, he sprang up
among its clustering papyrus plumes to perceive them
with Sensel. By this time, the people were quieting, and
Queen Atlana was being borne out. As the throng
pressed after her, Hellen was the better able to watch.
Great was his relief when Sensel began marshaling the
handmaids to their door. “If he can but get them to the
air,” he thought, “before more evil cometh.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Hid among the papyrus, he waited until all had
passed out even to the priest and handmaids in attendance
upon the altar fire.</p>

<p class='c011'>For once the great temple was deserted. Hellen was
alone. As he realized this, an idea came that he was
quick to act upon. Springing from the aperture, he
darted across the great space toward the door of the
handmaids, opened this, and beheld, stretching deep, the
passage through which Sensel had conducted him to the
priests’ gathering room; and knew that some distance
down, was the side passage leading to the cell where he
had seen the red-garbed figure. At the very end was a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>door leading, probably, to the building of the handmaids.
If he could but run down this long passage, and come
upon Æole and Electra!</p>

<p class='c011'>As if urged by a force uncontrollable, he sped onward—his
eyes, his thoughts on the door at the end. But,
when midway, was arrested, and by a voice. It was as
though a wall had sprung up in front of him. Low,
strong in fear, it warned.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Rash youth, thou wilt ruin all. Go back ere the
priests come. Wouldst thou die?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Hellen still would have pressed on.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Call to mind thy promise. If here thou art found, at
an end are the meetings with thy sister—the hope of freedom.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Hellen, now irresolute, was looking about him for the
red-garbed figure, when Sensel appeared through the far
door. For one moment, the latter stood motionless.
Then he bounded toward Hellen. Seizing his wrist, he
cried:</p>

<p class='c011'>“If thou lovest thy sister, out of this. Fly!”</p>

<p class='c011'>But Hellen shook off his hand as he answered:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Touch me not. I will go of my own will.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Sensel, holding with the more strength, began to draw
him along as with the force of the wind. On—on—they
sped, and into the temple. Here it was still empty,
but voices could be heard in the passage leading to the
inner sanctuary. Sensel cried:</p>

<p class='c011'>“On to the portal!” still holding fast. And Hellen,
at last realizing his rashness, complied. But not to escape.
The sanctuary door opened as they neared the
portal; and in came Oltis and Urgis.</p>

<p class='c011'>The former’s assurance had returned. But he paused
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>in dismay at beholding the temple thus deserted, and
Hellen and Sensel by the portal. The former was freeing
himself; the latter looked worsted, conquered rather
than conquering.</p>

<p class='c011'>Hurriedly the priests approached them. And Oltis
asked:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sensel, what doeth the youth here with thee?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He went not with the others. I would have forced
him away.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The place of a messenger is in the outer court,” said
Urgis sternly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He is the brother of Æole the handmaid.” Oltis’
tone was meaningful; and his glare boded such evil that
Hellen was roused to resentment. Though he returned
with surprising calm:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yea, I am the brother of Æole—her wretched brother.
When all fled the temple, I staid that I might follow her.
I was making my way through the passage when set
upon by Sensel, and carried back as if by the wind.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Oltis looked at Urgis. Triumph was in his eye.
And triumph responded. Though Urgis, in hypocritical
tone said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“The temple doth pride itself upon this strength of
Sensel.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I thought I was strong,” continued Hellen, as he regarded
Sensel.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou wilt find thy strength as naught here. Tell me—how
far was he, Sensel?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Most Honored and High Priest, he was well in the
passage. But I seized him, and speeded him here.”—Sensel’s
tone was very low.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Didst thou see aught?” demanded Oltis of Hellen.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>“I saw naught but doors and Sensel. Those doors are
the same I saw when brought before thee, Priest Urgis.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou shouldst say, ‘Chief of the Priests,’” corrected
Urgis, angrily.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then,—‘Chief of the Priests, Urgis.’” And Hellen
bowed to the ground, but with little of reverence.</p>

<p class='c011'>His manner was not lost upon Oltis. Though smooth
his tones, his eyes emitted a lurid satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He who cometh into that passage not bidden, mocketh
the holy laws of the temple. There is sore pain for
this sin.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There should be sore pain, then, for other sins. The
presence of the handmaids is a sin. Are the gods waiting?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Sensel’s eyes were piercing the rash Hellen, in their
indignation. Further, did they contain warning? It
seemed as though the latter predominated as Hellen looked
from Oltis to him. As for Oltis, he was exultant; though
most grave was his expression.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The youth would chide us of the great temple—would
even chide the gods. For such sin there is worse than
pain. He will go to the ‘Deeps.’—Sensel, the guards!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Sensel turned as if to obey, and then paused to arrange
his sandal.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hasten, Sensel. Every moment he doth stay bringeth
taint to the temple.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Taint!” returned Hellen. “It is ye—thyself and Oltis—who
bring taint upon the temple!—Thou, Oltis, hast
brought upon its face the black look of guile, the slime
of sense, the marring of every line of that pure grace so
long its own.—Tell me, where are the handmaids thou
didst thrust into thine inner holy place? Are they to be
my neighbors in thy ‘Deeps’?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>It was a revelation, the shrinking back of the two.
Never before had been such braving, such questioning!
Sensel and Hellen read but the one thing from their cowering
attitude.</p>

<p class='c011'>As the four stood mute, the door of the gathering
room was heard to open; and there entered the ‘Silent
Priest’ and several other priests. The latter at once
resumed their neglected duties; but the silent one hastened
toward the group by the portal.</p>

<p class='c011'>Oltis and Urgis were again breathing. And, strangely,
a great hope possessed Hellen as the ‘Silent Priest’ came
opposite him. Eloquent was the mysterious priest’s
glance from one to the other, so eloquent that Oltis, as
if against his will, explained:</p>

<p class='c011'>“This youth hath sinned. He pressed within the west
passage in search of his sister, the handmaid Æole.
Further, he hath scorned, mocked, Urgis and myself.
For these, he will go to the ‘Deeps.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>By a gesture, the ‘Silent Priest’ deprecated this going
to the ‘Deeps.’ But Oltis, though with less of determination
in voice and manner, iterated:</p>

<p class='c011'>“He will go to the ‘Deeps.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>Merely by the movement of his expressive hands, the
silent one referred to the earthquake and the mysterious
voice, and advised clemency as the youth had erred
from love of his sister. All Hellen was as quick to comprehend
as the priests, so ably did the gestures speak.
But Oltis continued:</p>

<p class='c011'>“He hath chided the gods. It is the crowning sin.
Sensel, the guards!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Sensel still hesitated. The ‘Silent Priest’ had glanced
at him, his glance expressing negation. As he stood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>irresolute, unmindful of the indignation of Oltis. The
‘Silent Priest’ took from an inside pocket a small roll of
papyrus, and signed to Sensel for reed and ink.</p>

<p class='c011'>When these were brought, he wrote in large Atlantean
characters swiftly:</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is the Festival of Poseidon. On this day, mercy is
ever shown all sinners. It is one of the oldest laws, the
law of King Atlas.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Oltis and Urgis read. And Oltis, with exceeding reluctance,
replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“We know it. It hath ever been kept.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The silent one wrote again:</p>

<p class='c011'>“There is an olden prophecy—‘<i>When the stranger
from a far land would seek his own within the temple, the
high priest is safe in forbearing of the heart.</i>’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A prophecy I laugh at,” sneered Oltis. Though his
uncertain looks testified to the opposite.</p>

<p class='c011'>He of silence again wrote:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Putting the olden law beside the olden prophecy
meaneth much on this day.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Oltis and Urgis looked at each other in doubt, more
than in doubt. For fear lurked behind the doubt—the
fear that comes of dread of penalty—the fear that will
attack the stoutest, most reckless villains, at times.
What was there in this mysterious priest that served to
tongue-tie them, as it were—yet loosened every evil and
falsity of their souls until their minds beholding, shrank
from such as though they were ghastly phantoms?
Finally, Urgis, in his quality of lesser villain, broke silence.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oltis, it would be well to think upon it. Let us speak
together.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will speak here,” vociferated Oltis. “There needeth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>no meddling priest, no speaking together to show me my
duty. If olden law and olden prophecy join, I must
obey. The youth can go free. But woe to him should
he sin again!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Well was it for Sensel that the two saw not the glad
light that came into his eyes, the happy color that swept
over his face. As for the silent one, the expression that
irradiated him was not detected, either, as, at the beginning
of Oltis’ words to Urgis, he had turned as if to walk
away. Yet again, and instantly, did he face them, for
Hellen’s voice was ringing:</p>

<p class='c011'>“O ‘Silent Priest’ I thank thee, I bow to thee. In
truth art thou of the gods—as the islanders say!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The silent one stretched out his hands to him in blessing;
and then, with a peculiar look at Oltis, moved away.
Oltis, with a strange drooping about him, turned to Sensel
with the order, “See the youth well away.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then to Hellen, he added, “Youth, go. But forget
not—that olden laws and olden prophecies will not ever
be at hand to save thee.”</p>

<p class='c011'>When Hellen had bowed to each, he turned after Sensel;
and followed his gliding, quivering, dust-colored
self to the gateway of the outer court. After Sensel,
without one word, had left him, Hellen went on to the palace
as if in a dream, absorbed over the ‘Silent Priest.’
Wonderful was the power of this grand man, amazing
the hopefulness that possessed him when this being came
opposite him! Was he, indeed, more than mortal as the
islanders hinted? Or were his powers natural in themselves,
but seldom bestowed upon man?</p>

<p class='c011'>That evening, it was evident to Æole and Electra that
Hellen was unduly disturbed, for his voice was husky,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>his eyes and color feverish. As to themselves, they were
very pale; and Æole owned to a feeling of weakness,
even looking in apprehension at the hill they were about
to mount. Perceiving this, Hellen, as he took an arm of
each, whispered:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Let us not climb the tower. We will go to the alley
on its right. There no one cometh this late. Though,
there are ears in the air.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is not so safe as the tower, Hellen.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There is still the noise of the bulls, Æole.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I forgot. May their zeal be great!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Electra laughed; and a little color came into her face.
“How I thank those bulls,” she said naively. “Well
are they worthy to be held in honor, and to be kept about
the temple!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The three laughed, their spirits lightening in accordance;
and they began to walk with briskness towards
the northern slope. As they neared the broad leafy
alley that extended downward to the right of the tower,
Æole paused to regard this distrustfully.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We could be followed, and not know it because of
the trees.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My eyes and ears will be well open,” said Hellen.</p>

<p class='c011'>Down the alley they hurried to come upon a thicket:
and here paused to listen. But no sounds could be
heard save the songs of the night birds and the faint
chanting of the priests—when the bulls permitted.</p>

<p class='c011'>As they were about to pass around the thicket, Hellen
thought to look backward up the alley—just as a tall
slender shape showed itself in entering; and darted for
this only to see it vanish. Vainly did he search on all
sides, thereupon returning scant of breath, but yet with
voice to air his indignation.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>“It could but be that Sensel—so fast did he fly. He is
an evil spirit!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Say not so, Hellen. He is good. Often doth he aid
Electra and myself. And the other handmaids never
tire of speaking of his kind deeds.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Æole, I forget not that he came upon me without
noise when I met the red shape.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hellen, I have the thought that good will come of
those two,” insisted Electra.</p>

<p class='c011'>They were around the thicket; and had come upon
one of the streams flowing down the mountain side. By
this they sat so as to face the thicket; and, under cover
of the noise of the bulls, Hellen began with this:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Æole, Electra, I have seen the queen.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The two jumped to their feet, and as quickly sat down
again. “Tell us!”—“Tell us!” they chorused.</p>

<p class='c011'>Hellen recounted all save the terrible part concerning
the handmaids. When he finished, they were weeping.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thinkest thou the queen will get well?” asked Æole,
finally.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Her spirit is mighty. She feeleth she should live to
help us. I fear not she will die.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Great is the wonder that she found strength to come
to the temple.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yea, but it is herself,” said Electra. “And well did
Atlano and Oltis cower before her. It passeth belief that
Oltis should thus deck himself when the law is strong
the priests shall ever wear white linen.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But, the ‘Silent Priest,’” interposed Æole, “was he
not as beyond earth? How did Oltis pale before him!
What shame did his pure raiment and silver circlet cast
upon the purple and gems of the high priest! And,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>even at my first look, what a spell took hold of me.
Hard was it to draw from him mine eyes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He is a power,” added Hellen. “The other priests
fear him while they look up to him. And, he doth cause
me to thrill with hope and strength at the first glance.
What is it?—Ah—never can I forget how he came before
these islanders!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Tell us of it, Hellen,” said Electra. “I, also, am drawn
to him. He seemeth more than man.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yea, Hellen—tell us—and hasten. The time doth
fly.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is a year since. One morning, while I was on the
sands, I chanced to see far off on the water a moving
speck. As it drew on, it proved to be a boat, and a boat
of strange behavior—for long it hovered far, as if it feared
to draw nigher. The islanders also noting this, watched
with me. After two hours, it began to near us a little.
Then it stopped.</p>

<p class='c011'>“So we on the sands beckoned. Thus on it came again.
And soon we saw that it was of odd shape, and held two
persons, one being clothed in white. Slow, very slow
was it in nearing us; but at length drew up on the sands,
amid our loud greetings.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then stepped among us this grand man robed in shining
white, and wearing about his head a circlet of silver
studded with golden stars. His was the garb of the
priests of Poseidon, save that he wore soft folds of white
about his brow beneath the circlet. So we pressed about
him to know whence he came. To our sorrow he answered
not by speech; but, by signs, made the king,
high priest, and all, to know that Amen had sent him to
serve in the temple, and that he would speak at such time
as the gods willed.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>“How chanced the king and high priest on the sands?”
inquired Electra.</p>

<p class='c011'>“When we had watched the strange behavior of the
boat for a while, we sent for them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But—the figure behind him?” asked Æole.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He sat still until the ‘Silent Priest’ signed for him to
come. It was Sensel.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now I call it to mind, Hellen. I heard thee tell of
it, but had forgotten.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yea, I told thee. This second figure was Sensel.
Out he glided, tall, slender, shining of eye, the color of
dust, and swaying. We fell back as though he was a
serpent; and watched him, charmed, as he took his place
beside the ‘Silent Priest.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think he is fair, noble,” urged Electra, “in spite of
his ugly dust garments and wavy walk. How his eyes
shine beneath that low cap he ever weareth!”</p>

<p class='c011'>This pleased Æole much. But Hellen looked severe.
In grimmest tone, he said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Look to it that he throweth not his spells about you.
Such charming is death!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hellen, thou hast need of more heart,” warned Æole.
“Thou art getting to look but for the evil in people.”
And she turned from him.</p>

<p class='c011'>This, coming from her, was a blow. Hellen was so
smitten, that Electra entreated:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Æole, thou hast wounded him. But—look upon him
with thy fond eyes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Æole obeyed to soften. Taking his hand, she said in
her loving way:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dear Hellen, how could I thus hurt thee. Forgive
me.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>He kissed her. “Dear Æole, how can I forgive when
naught doth need it. I am wrong to speak evil of
Sensel when he is kind to thee and Electra.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The last sentence though somewhat lacking in firmness,
yet was strong in its concession. In appreciation, sweet
peace hovered over them again; and Electra, that the
gentle presence might not go on the wing, hastened to
say:</p>

<p class='c011'>“But, Hellen, thou hast not told us all. And soon
should we go back.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There is little more. As to the ‘Silent Priest’ already
were we looking upon him as a higher being. And this
strange Sensel but added to our awe. When the king
and high priest had spoken further, by their signs, we
followed them to the temple. Here the new priest was
given place. Now he is a power, checking even Atlano
and Oltis. But few animals have been yielded on the
altar; and no handmaids have been called to the inner
holy place, since he hath been in the temple.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Æole and Electra shuddered. The latter whispered:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hellen, we are getting a dread of the inner holy
place.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What meanest thou?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The other handmaids tremble and grow pale at name
of it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We found it thus the first day,” added Æole. “Why
is it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ask me not, Æole. But pray that no more handmaids
may go in there.”</p>

<p class='c011'>They looked at him in fear.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hellen, much have we seen and heard that causeth
us to believe evil goeth on in the inner parts. I feel
as if the air, even, is not pure.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>“Dwell not upon such thoughts. I am sure that it
groweth brighter for us. Let me tell you what happened
after the earth quaked, after Sensel had led you from the
temple.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Hastily he recounted the whole, not omitting Sensel’s
perturbation. When he had finished, the two, of their
doubt and anxiety, were silent. Finally, Æole murmured:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hellen, what a risk was thine to go in that passage.
And thine awful words to the high priest.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have been smitten ever since. But the words would
come.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know, Hellen. But, take cheer. Be not so cast
down.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I fear it will bring evil to thee and Electra.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But—there are the ‘Silent Priest’ and Sensel,” urged
Electra.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If Sensel is our friend. Though he came with the
‘Silent Priest,’ he hath gained favor with Atlano and
Oltis. Both look to him; and both may have weight
with him. It may be it was at their order that he came
after us in the alley. He may be beyond that thicket
now.”—He pointed to the nearest clump.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will see,” returned Electra.</p>

<p class='c011'>Scarce had they accepted her words than she was
speeding off to the place designated, hopeful of convincing
Hellen of his injustice.</p>

<p class='c011'>But, when almost there, paused because of a significant
rustling. Though the pause was only for the instant.
Bravely she resumed her way; and was at the thicket
just as a tall form showed itself before vanishing!</p>

<p class='c011'>Poor Electra, overcome, could only turn and look to
Hellen, who had fast followed her. Pitiful was it to witness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>her trembling. Hellen, in his loving commiseration,
put his arm about her, nay, both arms; and thus supported
her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come, dear Electra, come away. Thou wilt be sick.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She burst into tears; and was emulated by the approaching
Æole. As she sobbed, she said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I grieve not to believe him our friend.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It doth not make him the less our friend that he hath
done this,” spoke Æole, with head held high. “How
know we but he is the more our friend in thus doing.
It is plain he was not there to hearken. It is too far
from the place where we sat.” Sweet was her majesty.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, then, didst thou weep?” asked the keen Hellen.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know not,” she faltered, her head lowering. “Unless
it was because—everything was so sudden—and
Electra was trembling and weeping.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wert thou in fear, Electra?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nay, Hellen, but I became without hope.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And I am, likewise. I fear he is not for us.” Hellen
was gloomily looking down.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have it,” exclaimed Æole. “He came to warn
us!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou hast it, Æole!”—Glad was Electra to clutch at
this straw.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why ran he then?” asked Hellen.</p>

<p class='c011'>This was unanswerable. The two lovely heads bent,
disconsolate, thus causing softening in Hellen. In gentlest
tones, he said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Let us not question it. And, it is time to go back.”</p>

<p class='c011'>As they went, he thought to ask: “Where are those
‘Deeps’?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They are beneath the temple. The handmaids whisper
of them in horror,” replied Electra.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>Nothing further was said until they reached the hillside
door, when they bade each other good-night dejectedly.
As the door was opening, Hellen whispered:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Beware of him!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER X.<br /> <span class='large'>LIGHT ON THE PATH.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The next evening, when Æole and Electra came out
upon the hillside, Hellen was not awaiting them. Then
did each own to anxiety; and, as the moments speeded,
their uncertainty became sickening. Finally, as some relief,
Æole proposed that they should go on to the alley.
To this both inclined, the more as voices were heard
nearing the temple from the southward. In the alley they
would be quite secure from interruption, as it was seldom
traversed after nightfall.</p>

<p class='c011'>So they sought its shade; and, just within its entrance,
paused to await Hellen.</p>

<p class='c011'>Exceeding was their relief when he joined them a little
later. Hard was he panting, not so much from his run,
as from dread that he had missed them. He muttered:</p>

<p class='c011'>“It hath been sore trouble to get here. It seemed as
though the messages of the king would end not.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It may be his thought to stop these meetings,” spoke
Æole.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The voice is yet too young,” reasoned Electra.
“Though, Oltis may master him. Ah, that voice! My
father told of one that was heard in a temple of Khemi,
and how the people hearkened unto it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It seemeth a helper either of gods or man,” said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>Æole. “It is ever in my thought that it cometh of our
parents, whether they be of earth or heaven.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Let us hope they are in heaven, Æole.” Hellen’s
voice was savage in his despair. “If they are of earth,
shame upon them!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hellen, I will not own thee, brother. Thus to charge
the best we have known in our lives. This is what Atlantis
hath done for thee!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Sweet peace was again spreading her wings. And
Electra was fearful she would get far away. Yet, Æole,
in her sweet indignation, was right. Hellen was almost
impious. In dread, she looked from one to the other.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Æole, our eyes were young when we were torn from
them. Young eyes are fond; they see no faults.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Would we had died young, Hellen. To grow old
enough to see faults, such faults in those so dear—and
to charge them—should cause one to sorrow for his
birth.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well would it be had we never seen the light.
Thinkest thou that I could have rested under it—thus to
be robbed of my children? I would have rent heaven to
get them!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hush, Hellen,” implored Electra. “Thou art sinning.
To dare to think of warring upon the gods!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yea—well could I war upon any gods, that could look
down, and not check such evil. And make their heaven
a thing of naught!”</p>

<p class='c011'>He looked upon the shocked face of his reprove—to
become penitent; and mourned:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Electra—Æole—it is ye who make me sin. My
days and nights hold but one thought—how to free you
from the taint of the temple—from this island, this fair,
most evil spot—from this your dire slavery.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>Of their pity, they seized his hands. Each implored
him not to be so bitter, but to be calm, even hopeful, and
to consider that God’s ways are not the ways of men.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus stood they absorbed, unheedful of a gliding,
noiseless shape that was speeding toward them; that
paused when near them to gaze with eyes of pity, love;
that, of its magnetism, was quick to draw Hellen’s glance
upon itself.</p>

<p class='c011'>Gently did Hellen release the two clinging figures as
he eyed the quivering Sensel. Then, with a bound, he
was almost upon him, his hands outstretched to strangle.
But, swift as a dart, did Sensel move to one side, there to
stand motionless, and regard Hellen with eyes wonderful
in their keenness and brilliancy.</p>

<p class='c011'>Again did Hellen bound almost upon him; and again
did the swaying figure, with the same astonishing celerity,
change its place.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Enough of this play, Sensel,” cried Hellen, seeing it
was futile to come upon him. “Tell me—what meanest
thou by stealing upon us to view our misery?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Sensel gracefully pointed upward; and, in low, musical
tones, answered:</p>

<p class='c011'>“There are gods in the heavens. Why cease to hope?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There are not gods for us. Parents—heaven—gods—are
proving myths. The evil spirits, though, have being.”
Meaningful was Hellen’s tone and look. “Yea,
the evil spirits have being, and to good purpose for this
island.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou hast thrown from thee, then, the warm feeling
for the Higher Good, the trust of thine early years.
Only the evil spirits have being!” Strong was Sensel in
his rebuking. “Because sorrow is thine, there is no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>Higher Good. Because thou art not happy, only evil
ruleth. Look to thyself! For false spirits close about
thee. Their thoughts are thine. Therefore cometh thy
lack of warmth to the gods, of trust—thy wicked
thoughts. Hellen, beware!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Æole and Electra drank in these words; and then
looked furtively at Hellen. Glad were they to see he was
touched, that he seemed conscience-stricken. And he
was conscience-stricken, for Sensel’s tones were even
more forcible than his words. After some moments, he
admitted:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sensel, I own that thou speakest truth. Of late, I
have lost warmth, trust. The Higher Good hath been
shunned. But I am wild—torn with fears for these.
Therefore, canst thou wonder—blame?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wonder not. I blame not. But I have come to
tell thee the clouds will lift. Soon will light be on thy
path. Be calm, and wait. Thou art not forgotten of
gods or man.”</p>

<p class='c011'>With a farewell wave of the hand, he turned away, and
glided beyond the thicket.</p>

<p class='c011'>Hellen moved as if to follow him; but checking himself,
moaned:</p>

<p class='c011'>“He is right. Long is it since I have looked to the
Higher Powers. My trust is gone. I have been mad.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hellen, my trust hath not failed. Sure am I that all
is for our good.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Æole, thine are ever warmth, trust. But I am cold,
full of doubt.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“After the way of men,” interposed Electra. “Men
are cold of heart toward the Higher Powers, but to reason
the more: and, of their reasoning, see the less.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>“Thou art right. Ah, Electra, if thou wouldst but
help me.” He looked at her with tenderest eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou shouldst ask help only of the Higher Good
and Truth, Hellen.” Electra was blushing.</p>

<p class='c011'>Æole, though listening, was thinking deep upon Sensel.
During Hellen’s last words, she was even saying to
herself, “What a glance is that of Sensel. What a voice
is his. Without doubt, he is good. After this night,
Hellen can but believe in him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So full was she of this last thought, that out she spoke:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hellen, Sensel is our friend. Now wilt thou be sure.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Unless he is full of guile, Æole.” Then, because of
her hurt expression, he hastened to add, “Æole, doubt
hath firm hold of me. But thou wilt forgive.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She was silent. Therefore, Electra entreated:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hellen, thine is a strong, honest spirit,—but it is
weighed down by these doubts. Throw them off that
thou mayst soar to find trust, peace.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Hellen, gazing into her earnest eyes, and listening to
her thrilling tones, was so carried away that he responded:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Electra, but to hearken to thee is to rise higher.
Come, dear one,—give me thy hand—that some of the
grand ether filling thee may pass into my poor frame—to
give life to my spirit, to raise it a little to the heights
thou speakest. Ah, Electra, my strength is of the body.
Give me that of the spirit.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Electra was mute, though she held out her hand.
This he took, and continued:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dost thou not feel how my hand leapeth because of
thy living words? And thine will I keep as we go back,
for it is time that we part again.” So did his look linger
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>upon her, that she, paling, glanced at Æole to meet her
sad eyes fixed upon them. Already was she understanding
Hellen’s feeling for Electra; and she feared for him,
feared for his further suffering. Electra meeting this
sad gaze, thought, “She is not pleased with me.” And
answered by a look so humble and beseeching that
Æole darted to embrace her, and say with utmost expression:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dear, dear Electra!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yea, dear Electra, it is!” Hellen was elated.
“And dear Æole! Now, ye dear ones, take hold of me.
For, it is time that we go.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Each clung to him; then buoyantly they sped to the
temple.</p>

<p class='c011'>The next evening, Hellen was again delayed; and
again hastened to the alley, hoping there, as before, to
rejoin the waiting ones.</p>

<p class='c011'>But, in the alley, they were not. Neither beyond the
thicket.</p>

<p class='c011'>Back he rushed to the tower with the faint hope that
they might be teasing. But neither were they here—not
even at the top.</p>

<p class='c011'>In a great dread, he tore down the staircase, and to the
hillside door;—thence back through the alley, and beyond
the thicket: and there paused to gaze on the stream
as if it, if it would, might help him.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then he called; and, for response, heard but the bulls
that seemed to mock at him. Where were they? Could
they be hiding? Were they laughing in some near nook
over his distracted movements? No—too well he knew
their tender hearts, their impatience ever to greet him!</p>

<p class='c011'>But, perhaps Sensel had come beyond the thicket,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>was there laughing at his distress. Hellen waited,
even hoping he might step forth. Hard was it to bear
up as the moments crept on, as his imagination grew
riotous.</p>

<p class='c011'>Erelong, he started to run back to the alley. And
was on the point of rounding the thicket, when a tall
figure came upon him.</p>

<p class='c011'>But, it was not Sensel. No, this was King Atlano!
And without attendants.</p>

<p class='c011'>At Hellen’s stony stare, the king smiled derisively;
and asked:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why art thou in such haste? Thou camest near
falling upon me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“King Atlano, I seek my sister and Electra.” For his
life Hellen could not bow.</p>

<p class='c011'>This the king noted. Though he corrected him not,
but said, as if indifferent:</p>

<p class='c011'>“So, here is the place where ye meet.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“For two nights past have we met here—as thou
knowest, King Atlano.” Hellen was now calm, and
looking fearlessly at his tormentor. “This third night,
they come not.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nay—they come not!” The king laughed as the
evil spirits might.</p>

<p class='c011'>“King Atlano, will they come?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They will not come.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why?” The hot blood was surging now.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I like not these meetings. Evil will come of it.
Other handmaids will ask to creep out, and meet their
brothers—or, fonder ones.” Again the king laughed,
and so that Hellen writhed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But, the voice hath willed that we meet.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>“I doubt the voice. It may be jugglery<a id='r19'></a><a href='#f19' class='c012'><sup>[19]</sup></a>—jugglery
known to Khemi. There such arts are beginning.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then is all in the temple jugglery!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou forgettest fear, awe. For such there is pain.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Tell me, King Atlano, where are Æole and Electra?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Again the king smiled, and replied suavely:</p>

<p class='c011'>“This night hath Æole been called to the inner holy
place. Electra will go in on the morrow.” So gloating
had become his look and tone that Hellen grasped at the
air as if to steady himself; and repeated, dazed:</p>

<p class='c011'>“In the inner holy place?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yea.” Atlano’s tone was soft though his eyes
gleamed cruelly. “The priests have willed that thou art
to be parted from Æole and Electra. Their stay, for the
coming time, is in the inner holy place.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Hellen’s agony was bewildering. Despair so clogged
his utterance that he could only gasp:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not that—not that!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is a high honor.” The king regarded him in triumph
and derision.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Hellen’s tongue loosed. He towered grand in
his passion.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou knowest it is not a high honor. Thou knowest
thine inner holy place is a hell. Thou knowest that
thyself and those priests are fiends worse than those of
hell—for ye are fair in seeming, and fiends look what
they are. Ye are monsters of self and sense! And, by
your arts have ye worked upon these islanders, until they
see with your eyes, walk in your ways.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But—think ye there is no coming pain for this? Oh,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>poor, wretched, groveling King, I tell thee sorrow and
pain fast near thee. In the height of this thy power cometh
thy fall. The powers above are raging at thee.
Their vengeance is sure. It playeth about thee now. It
is ready to dart upon thee. It will crush thee. May it
come this night!”</p>

<p class='c011'>And Hellen sank upon his knees to implore:</p>

<p class='c011'>“O ye Gods, send down your shafts of flame to confound
this monster! O spare to Æole and Electra their
purity! Smite them dead ere worse befalleth them!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The king listened as if turned to stone. The audacity
of this youth was more dreadful than his words. Whilst
he stood glaring, and unable to speak, Hellen arose, and,
in commanding tone, said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yield to me Electra and Æole.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, thou askest for Electra first,” was sneered with
strange slowness and huskiness.</p>

<p class='c011'>Hellen darted for him, and in his young strength, and
emotion, would doubtless have prevailed had he not been
mastered by the same force that had rendered him helpless
when endeavoring to rescue Æole from the temple’s
guards. An essence pungent and pleasant was thrown
at him by Atlano, and he sank upon the ground. As he
lay inert, the king continued:</p>

<p class='c011'>“As for thyself, it was meant thou shouldst join the
warmen in a falling upon the Afrite coast at a place
where treasure can be gained. But, because of thy
words, thou shalt be yielded on the altar. Amen and
Poseidon are again calling for blood, as the late troubles
prove.”</p>

<p class='c011'>A fearful nausea came upon Hellen. He struggled to
defy:</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>“Thou mockest Amen and Poseidon. My yielding upon
the altar—all such—come of thy longing for blood. But
the gods thou wouldst make so vile are ready to fall
upon thee for the base deeds thou doest in their name.
Rather would I be yielded on thine altar than stand in
thy place!”</p>

<p class='c011'>With fiendish face, the king bounded upon him, and
would have strangled him had not a rustling been
heard in the thicket. He looked to see Sensel glide out,
quivering and pallid.</p>

<p class='c011'>“King Atlano, thou art wanted in the temple. A
great evil hath befallen.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Æole! Electra!” panted Hellen.</p>

<p class='c011'>The king turned to go, but Hellen’s feeble hand caught
at his robe.</p>

<p class='c011'>“King Atlano, yield me upon thine altar if thou wilt,
but spare Æole and Electra. It is but a crumb.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Atlano, smiling as the fiends, removed the hand, saying:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou wilt hear from me with the morn.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then, motioning to Sensel to lead the way, he rejoined
the attendants awaiting him in the alley.</p>

<p class='c011'>Hellen watched until he had disappeared. If he could
but move—but fly after him—but crush him!</p>

<p class='c011'>Not long though, did his agony endure. It was
scarcely five minutes when the thicket again rustled.
The startled Hellen listened, and with hope. The rustling
was repeated. Then, wonderful, his muscles began to
grow less rigid, his blood to course warmer. In another
moment he was leaping to his feet, and towards the
thicket—when, from behind it, appeared the ‘Silent
Priest’!</p>

<p class='c011'>“The ‘Silent Priest,’” murmured poor Hellen.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>The silent one approached, and extended his hands to
grasp Hellen’s. Instantly, their soft, firm pressure gave
confidence and strength to the forlorn youth. All fear
and distrust vanished, and he looked into the noble
countenance bending over him with strange yearning.</p>

<p class='c011'>The priest signed that Hellen must follow him; and
he acquiesced, feeling as if this strange being could
draw him to the worlds end. Arm in arm they walked
to the tower, to mount it, the priest showing an agility
as great as Hellen’s.</p>

<p class='c011'>They sat down on the ledge. And, to Hellen’s amaze, a
sudden, strong hope possessed him. Could it be owing
to the tender manner of this priest? Or could the warm
pressure of his hand have aught to do with it? Neither
spoke, and both turned their eyes to the water, in the
direction of the far-off Pelasgia. After a little, Hellen
moaned:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah—home, home! As if we sorrowed not enough
in being torn from it! Yet, what was that pain to this?
The woe of this night! Tell me, ‘Silent Priest’—how
can I save my pure ones, or kill them ere too late?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My son, a way openeth. Thou wilt come out of this
with thy sister. But woe—woe—to this wicked island!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Great was the shock to Hellen at the first tones of this
voice. But it was as nothing to that which followed.
For, this hitherto voiceless priest was not only giving
utterance to Atlantean speech at the first, but continuing
his sentences in Pelasgian.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who art thou?” Hellen seized his garment and
stared, bewildered, in his face.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Have care, Hellen. I am no priest of Poseidon.
Feelest thou not—who—I am?” The ‘Silent Priest’
extended his arms in longing.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>Hellen was speechless from the ecstasy of hope.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hellen, this is but a mask—this garb. Feelest thou
not—that—I am—?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My—father?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yea—yea—Hellen, thy father!”</p>

<p class='c011'>But Hellen was unconscious in the arms so eagerly
enfolding him. His strained condition could not bear
this quick change from agony to joy. Self-reproachful,
his father chafed his hands, and gave him of a medicine
he carried within his vestment. Overwhelming was his
relief when Hellen unclosed his eyes to look at him, and
opened his arms for a long embrace.</p>

<p class='c011'>When he was able to sit up, his father whispered:</p>

<p class='c011'>“We have need of care. The stones have eyes, the air
hath ears. Now, hearken, for soon will I go back to the
temple.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Hellen pressed his hand in assent; then asked:</p>

<p class='c011'>“But, first—mother. Is she well?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thy mother is as well as she can be under her great
grief.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The gods be thanked. Ah, what a wretch am I!
Father, when thou knowest my evil heart, thou wilt not
own me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Fear not, Hellen. Thou art but man. And now,
hearken.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hellen, after the Atlanteans had borne away thyself
and Æole, I reached Larissa to find thy mother nigh to
death. Day and night I watched until she came out of
the shadow. Then I besought ransom of the people.
But they were deaf, in their rage at the Atlanteans. I
ceased my pleadings after it was given me to feel, yea,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>to see—hidden things—and to be sure that all would end
well.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then came new misery. The tribes to the north
sought battle with us; and I was forced to leave thy
mother, and go against them. For a year did this last.</p>

<p class='c011'>“In the end, the loss and ruin were theirs. Then came
I home to find thy mother again nigh to death. But,
after a little, new life came to her, and with it hope. She
was strong in the thought that we should get our children—was
of one mind with me—for, if knowledge can
come from above, such was mine. But of this later.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yea, thy mother was her old self, and urged me to
again plead with the king and people for help. Our
hopes proved in reason, for they agreed to lend us a few
vessels. Then friends gathered about us to do the rest.
And I built the boat in which I came hither.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thus, after years of dread waiting, thy mother and I,
with these dear friends, sailed for the Great Rock that
riseth where the Middle Sea joineth the ocean. There,
under its shadow, I left them. And, as a priest of Poseidon,
came to these Atlanteans.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, Hellen, that day I knew thee, even as my foot
pressed the sands. Hard was it to keep from flinging
myself upon thee in thy strong young grace and pure
look. Hellen, my dear son, all I had borne was as
naught when I beheld thee. How it was that I ran not
to thee to cry, ‘Hellen, here is thy father!’ I know not.
So strong was my yearning.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And, father, what were my feelings. Thy grand
looks seemed beyond earth. Ah, how thou didst draw
me! Though, after that, was I willing to think of thee
evil.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was nature working in thee.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>“But—how these Atlanteans have bent, yielded to
thee.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They fear the gods now that they have become
wicked, and dare not make light of my warnings.
Though Atlano and Oltis hate me, and would harm me
if they dared. How often, by my signs, have I chided
them, and made them cease their evil. Upon their fears
am I working that I may free thyself and Æole. Oh,
most wretched people!”</p>

<p class='c011'>He had arisen. And raised his eyes as if imploring
heaven’s mercy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But—Sensel—who is he, father?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Deucalion sat down again, and whispered:</p>

<p class='c011'>“He is young Prince Pelasgus, the son of our king.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Hellen, of his surprise, exclaimed so loud that his
father again cautioned him. As he sat confounded, it
was to listen to this.</p>

<p class='c011'>“During our struggle with the tribes to the north, he
served under me; and dear did we become to each other.
He is noble, brave, good, and so true that he would not
hearken that I should come without him. Though with
ill grace was his father willing. But in all Pelasgia, there
was not a youth who could run, turn, and bend himself
as Prince Pelasgus—not one so strong. Thus he asked
to use these gifts as a mask in my service. After some
days, he came before me in his present shape; and I saw
that this mask of serpent look would aid me. I now
know that I could not have done without him. Sensel
is an able one. And—the voice is his.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Father!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is as I say. It is but in nature. Sensel learned it
of a captive taken when the northern tribes fell upon us.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>He said it was quite common in his own land. But, as
most of his tribe were killed, it is almost as if of the hidden.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How will Æole and Electra glory in this,” was said
with due penitence. “From the first, they liked and
trusted him. But I—how have I tried to stifle their
belief in him. How have I scorned him for his serpent
ways, his services to king and priests.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is a lesson for thee. But look—yonder he cometh.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Let us go to him, father. I would kneel for his pardon.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not here, my son.”</p>

<p class='c011'>They descended from the tower. Upon meeting, Hellen
would have embraced Sensel, had his father permitted it.
As it was, his expressive face testified to his regret, his
contrition for his unjust opinion, his former contempt,
even before he whispered of such to the responsive Sensel.</p>

<p class='c011'>Afterward, still under cover of the bulls, were imparted
to Hellen confidences at which he marveled. Then Deucalion
and Sensel hastened to the temple.</p>

<p class='c011'>Hellen remained to walk up and down the alley in a
condition of mind far removed from that in which he had
parted from Atlano. Now hope was not only showing
herself, but promising abiding.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Note.</span>—“Down to the present century, ventriloquism was regarded
as a physiological mystery. And, of old, it seemed awful
when the river Nessus saluted Pythagoras, when a tree spoke before
Apollonius, and when a newborn infant, or animals, or statues
talked.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XI.<br /> <span class='large'>THE HAPPENING OF THE UNEXPECTED.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Deucalion entered the hillside door to be met in the
court by several weeping handmaids, one of whom cried
out to him:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Æole is no more. Æole is no more!”</p>

<p class='c011'>He paused, and his look questioned; when another
handmaid answered.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She had just been called to the inner holy place,
when, therein, we heard a great stir, and Sensel ran out
to cry that she was lying dead at the foot of the statue
of Amen. He had borne her in there, as she, of her
grief, fell even at the door. Ah, poor Æole—poor
Æole!”</p>

<p class='c011'>This handmaid began to sob so that she could not
continue. Then another handmaid spoke for her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thus we ran to the inner holy place, forgetting we
should not go there. And, at the foot of Amen, beheld
her as Sensel had said, whilst about her were gathering
the high priest and the other priests. At first we could
not believe her dead; and rubbed her hands, and bathed
her brow. But she would not arouse. Now is the cold
of death upon her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And this handmaid began to sob loud, the others joining
with her. So extreme was their grief that Deucalion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>could obtain no further information, in spite of his
many signs. Thus he left them to hasten to the inner
sanctuary.</p>

<p class='c011'>This apartment, upon entering, gave the impression of
mystery, luxury, sensuousness—anything save devotion—notwithstanding
its golden altar at the eastern end, its
sacred fire thereon; notwithstanding its great golden
statues of Amen and Poseidon, the one to the altar’s
right, the other to its left, and both most wonderful in
their size, majesty, and benignity of mien.</p>

<p class='c011'>Everywhere in this inner sanctuary were gold and silver
used lavishly. And, in the available places, were set
magnificent gems, that, in their artful clustering, simulated
flowers and fruits, thus affording the needful climax
to all the splendors.</p>

<p class='c011'>Glowing with orichalcum and clustering gems was the
ceiling, while from it hung golden lamps resplendent in
jewels. In corners, smoked silver vessels emitting perfumes
whose subtlety overmastered the will. About the
greenstone columns, the rarest flowers were wreathed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet, incongruously with the taste displayed, the fitness
of the splendors, were the effeminate furnishings. Softest
mats covered the tiled floor; couches, stands, and
tables of fantastic workmanship were scattered about;
whilst, in the center, stood a larger table containing stimulating
drinks, fruits and sweetmeats. And elegant
hangings fell from the doors.—Could this indeed be a
sanctuary?</p>

<p class='c011'>The vast apartment was a dream of luxury and sensuousness;
and, from the half-opened doors at its northern
end, could be gained a faint idea of the sumptuousness
of its withdrawing rooms. No wonder was it that,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>upon entering, the mind, instead of concentrating upon
things divine, should become enthralled by dreams of
sense!</p>

<p class='c011'>The great Amen was represented as a human being
with the head of a ram, for the reason, doubtless, that he
was considered as standing in the same relation to the
people that the ram does to the flock. He was guide,
governor, and protector. And, about his head was a
crown simulating the sun’s rays. For, Amen was the
Sun God.</p>

<p class='c011'>Æole had been laid on a couch near this statue; and
about her were gathered handmaids and priests. Yes,
here, pale and motionless, lay the lovely form hushing
the gazers into awe. Here, revelry had given away to a
strange quiet. Here, the handmaids, with blanched
faces, were restraining their sobbing. Here, priests were
looking from the dead to each other, mystified and apprehensive.
Here, Atlano and Oltis were ever casting
terrified, quickly averted looks at the statue of Amen
that seemed to frown in response.</p>

<p class='c011'>As the ‘Silent Priest’ took his place among the watchers,
they turned as one to regard him. But, unmindful
of their questioning gaze, his eyes rested long upon the
waxen form. Finally, at an impatient movement from
Oltis, he raised his head, and flashed from him to Atlano
a look so condemnatory that the spectators shook
with dismay. Though neither of the ones thus rebuked
gave any response, save to turn as if to look upon the
dead girl.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then, the ‘Silent Priest’ moved toward the statue of
Amen. But, had scarcely reached it, when attracted by
the sudden incoming of Electra. As if beside herself,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>she ran to kneel before him; and in tones as persuasive
as piteous, entreated:</p>

<p class='c011'>“O ‘Silent Priest,’ is this how the gods would help?
If thou wilt but heed me. Beseech of them that I, too,
may go. Life is such a woe that I am tempted to end
it. Ah, to die with Æole! If thou wilt but plead with
Amen and Poseidon to have mercy upon me—as they
have had upon her. Let me go to her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He took her hand. And, oh the sudden strength that
came to her! In an instant, she was no longer despairing.
Then, he signed for her to arise; and she stood up
as a queen.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Silent Priest,’ thou hast spoken. It is not mine to
ask thee to beseech the gods. If it is their will I should
sorrow more, I must bear. I will chafe no longer.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He regarded her with approbation; and bowed in acquiescence.
She felt he was saying inwardly:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Keep this, thy humility. It will lead thee to light.
May the gods cheer thee.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Though the tears were welling thick in her eyes, for
all her strength. As these fell, she moaned, “Hard,
hard, will it be without Æole. How soon she filled my
heart. From the first was I fond of her. And fond was
she to me!” Then, impetuously, with arms outstretched,
she turned to run toward the couch, when called by one
of several handmaids entering from the passage.</p>

<p class='c011'>She paused. They came beside her; and the handmaid
who had called, whispered: “We have made ready
the bed of lilies in front of the altar. There Æole will
lie until the embalmers send the word. We have come
for her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Painful was it to witness Electra’s pallor. She murmured:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>“Let us draw beside her. I would kiss her.”
Whereupon, this handmaid led the suffering girl in
among the watchers, and to the place where she could
take Æole’s hand—to kiss, to bathe it with her tears.</p>

<p class='c011'>One of the handmaids left then spoke to a priest. This
priest, in turn, spoke to Oltis. Thus Oltis, in loud tone,
asked:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where is Sensel?”</p>

<p class='c011'>In answer, Sensel appeared in the passage. Oltis
ordered:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Bring the white robe.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Sensel left to return at once with a robe of lamb’s
wool, pure as snow. Oltis continued:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wrap therein the maiden. And bear her to the bed
of lilies.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Touching was the reverence with which Sensel enfolded
Æole in this. Amid the hysterical sobbing of the handmaids,
he raised her in his arms. And bore her, as a
babe might have been borne, through the great apartment
to the passage, and thence into the temple; king, priests,
handmaids following.</p>

<p class='c011'>Upon the bed of lilies was Æole laid—the robe being
removed. With loving touch, the handmaids drew her
long gown about her feet, and arranged the hands and
arms. Then they kissed the sweet forehead, and caressed
the long, shining hair. After this, they ranged about her
and the kneeling Electra, who had again taken a hand to
clasp to her breast. Thus, they awaited the summons of
the embalmer.</p>

<p class='c011'>Crowds of people were arriving, so fast had spread the
news. Even Queen Atlana came to hang stricken but
unweeping over the body of this young girl she had loved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>so well. Hellen also came, to stand and gaze fixedly
upon the dear, calm face.</p>

<p class='c011'>In an hour, word was brought that the embalmers
were ready. Amid the stir that ensued, the attendants
deputed moved to the sides of the bed of lilies, in order
to bear it with its lovely burden to the embalming room.
But, scarcely had they taken their places than rendered
motionless by the shrill cry from Hellen:</p>

<p class='c011'>“See! Her eyelids quiver!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Awful was the hush. Instantly, the ‘Silent Priest’ was
beside Æole, and looking in her face. Breathlessly the
people waited until he turned to sign that Hellen spoke
the truth. Then went up a great cry of gladness. Then
sank the relieved queen in the arms of her ladies. Then
arose Electra from her knees to stare at the ‘Silent Priest’
incredulously.</p>

<p class='c011'>Atlano and Oltis came forward for inspection; and
found confirmation. Oltis said to the people:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of a truth, her eyelids quiver. She is not dead.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Another glad shouting went up. Each felt as thankful
as though the young girl was his own. From Queen
Atlana, the blessed tears of hope were beginning to flow;
whilst Electra, in her revulsion of feeling, so tottered
that Hellen darted to her side to sustain her.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then, while the people were quieting somewhat, and
the handmaids were sobbing loud for gladness, the attendants
and messenger from the embalmers retired.</p>

<p class='c011'>Still Æole lay passive. Even the eyelids had ceased
to quiver. Yet, the faintest tinge of pink was coming
into her cheeks. The great throng about her scarcely
pulsated more than herself in its expectation of the unexpected
when those beside her proclaimed this new development.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>There was a long interval of suspense. Then arose
the cry:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Look! Her lips part!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Terrible was the hush. Would she speak? Would
her soft tones issue forth?</p>

<p class='c011'>Instead, there came upon them a sound as of the
sweeping wind—a sound, that, as it became intelligible,
caused the listeners to shake as aspens. This must be
the voice of a mighty spirit! And these words none
could mistake.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Atlanteans, I would warn. There are gods! Therefore,
call to mind how ye have set aside the olden laws,
what mockeries ye have brought upon temple and inner
holy place.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Further, hold no longer the Pelasgian children. This
day, give them over unto the ‘Silent Priest.’ He, with
the sun of the morrow, will bear them to their home.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The lips closed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Atlano and the priests had listened, shivering. Theirs
was the corruption of these islanders—theirs, the profanations
of altar and sanctuary. The sharp spear of dread
was piercing them. It was minutes before Atlano could
control himself to ask humbly:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mighty Spirit, is it in truth the will of our Father
Poseidon that we give over the captives to the ‘Silent
Priest’?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou speakest it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Tell our father that we hearken. We pray that he
will plead for us with Amen.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is heard.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There succeeded an awful silence. It was felt that the
mighty spirit had departed. And, as before, Æole lay as
dead.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>Though the throng, in its expectation wavered not—to
be rewarded within an hour. For then, Hellen cried:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Look—look! Again cometh the color into her
cheeks!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Frantically were they pressing about her when waved
back by the ‘Silent Priest.’ The queen and Electra, of
their trembling, required support. As to Atlano and
Oltis, they seemed as if turned to stone.</p>

<p class='c011'>There came another cry from Hellen:</p>

<p class='c011'>“She doth breathe! Her eyes open!”</p>

<p class='c011'>He bent over her in such agitation that the ‘Silent
Priest’ thought best to lead him away, and beside Electra.
She held out to him her hand, which he seized.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hellen, dear Hellen, be calm,” she whispered. “Our
strength is needed. The gods are with us.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She cast a grateful look at Sensel, who stood between
them and Æole vibrating and brilliant, and who returned
her look with one that meant victory.</p>

<p class='c011'>Meanwhile, the handmaids had been applying to
Æole’s nostrils a sponge dampened with a pungent liquor
brought by Oltis. Under its influence, she quickly
revived, and shortly was being propped up on cushions,
whilst about her was tucked the robe of lambs’ wool.
Afterward, the ‘Silent Priest’ brought her a drink which
caused her to be quite herself, though her bewilderment
at her surroundings proved her unconsciousness of what
had occurred.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the priests, of their doubt, would question her.
Therefore, Oltis was not long in asking: “Handmaid
Æole, didst thou dream in thy sleep?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Æole, reddening and paling, replied feebly:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Most Honored and High Priest, I dreamed not.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>“Knowest thou aught of what hath happened since
thou wert found as if dead?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Most Honored and High Priest, I know naught since
I fell before Amen in the inner holy place, and besought
him to take me from this life.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Oltis shrank back, and a murmur arose that swelled
through the vast assemblage. This murmur grew to a
shout as Queen Atlana, who had not shown herself,
leaned over, and clasped Æole to her.</p>

<p class='c011'>With a glad cry that brought tears to the eyes near
her, the young girl returned the embrace, and kissed
again and again the hands of this almost mother.</p>

<p class='c011'>But soon Queen Atlana raised to her full height, to
her lovely, gracious bearing, and looked about her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Atlanteans,” she said, with a world of meaning.
Delighted cries answered her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Atlanteans, am I right to take her back to the palace—this
fair young captive who hath grown to be my
daughter?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Deafening were the shouts:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yea! Yea!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ye will aid me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We will! We will!”</p>

<p class='c011'>She turned to Rica, and said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Order a chair.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This Rica proceeded to do of an attendant, as Atlano,
in a rage, vociferated:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nay!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Queen Atlana again spoke to Rica: “I will have the
chair.” Then to Atlano, she said low, and with emphasis:
“If I am not obeyed, I go not back to the palace.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>They eyed each other as no man and wife should.
Hard is it when a wife is obliged, in presence of others,
to assert herself. Terrible is it to perceive a husband’s
face take on an expression murderous! The people
again clamored their indignation until Atlana herself
quieted them by the eloquence of her hands. Though
there continued cries here and there for the chair.</p>

<p class='c011'>King Atlano had turned aside in sullen discomfiture,
when the queen again spoke the word for the chair.
And now it was brought beside her, and eagerly, if it
must be told.</p>

<p class='c011'>The attendants were thronging to lift Æole therein
when Sensel pressed in among them, to urge:</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is mine to lift her, to bear her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Before they had scarcely accepted his purpose, she
was raised from the bed of lilies and placed in the chair,
and he waited calm beside it.</p>

<p class='c011'>The queen’s look pierced him, but he returned it
proudly, growing so brilliant that her look became one
of amaze. Then, to her surprise, as well as that of the
beholders, she bowed in consent. With that, Sensel
and an attendant bore the chair on to the queen’s chariot.</p>

<p class='c011'>As Queen Atlana turned to follow, she beckoned to
Electra. Electra then came beside her, and the queen
subjoined:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Electra, thou wilt come also.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Unmindful of the scowling king, she took the hand of
the overjoyed young girl, and passed with gracious
smiles through the lines of intent islanders, whose love
showed in their looks, whose sympathy breathed in eloquent
undertones. Quickly they were entering the
great broad low chariot, on whose soft cushions reclined
Æole.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>Sensel was standing very near her. He had been
talking with her, and she was smiling, rosy. Further,
to the surprise of the queen and Electra, she held out
her hand when they were about to drive off, and said, in
her gracious way:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will give the parting word, Sensel.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou wilt do that after I have seen thee in the palace,”
he returned, in his brilliant manner. Then the
chariot drove away.</p>

<p class='c011'>True to his word, he was in the courtyard when they
arrived, and not only that, but would lift her out,
would place her in the chair, would help to bear her
within. When no more could be done for her, he said,
in softest tone:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now is my parting word, Æole.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then bowing low and elegantly to the queen, he darted
away in his most undulatory fashion.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What a strange being,” exclaimed Queen Atlana.
“But I like him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“So do we,” murmured Æole, and blushed.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XII.<br /> <span class='large'>THE EARTHQUAKE CONFOUNDS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>In the inner sanctuary, the lamps were casting feeble
radiance, the altar fire acting strangely capricious, when
Atlano, Oltis, Urgis, and the superior priests met for
conference upon the day’s awful events.</p>

<p class='c011'>Close they drew their couches, and reclined to cast
about them looks serious, apprehensive. Only too apparent
was the ease affected by Atlano and Oltis as they
surveyed the dark countenances upon which alarm was
setting its seal—as they averted their faces from the
majestic, upright figure that was eyeing them so fixedly.</p>

<p class='c011'>This silent one—how they were longing to fall upon
him, to strangle, to trample him under their feet! What
was the strange power that held them—that forced them
to his will? Cravens had they become!</p>

<p class='c011'>After an ominous quiet of some minutes, and when
Atlano was beginning to chafe under the anxious gaze
of these white-robed, imposing figures, he said, with
affected buoyancy,</p>

<p class='c011'>“This night we meet not here for mirth. The troubles
of the day claim our thought. But, first, I would ask are
any among you shaken—weak of spirit?”</p>

<p class='c011'>They looked at each other in doubt how to answer.
Finally, Hafoe, a priest old in wickedness, spoke out.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>“O King, I believe the gods are in this. I believe they
look upon us in anger.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Atlano’s was the utmost suavity. “Though why
should the gods look upon us in anger, Hafoe?”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was silence.</p>

<p class='c011'>Oltis, who had been glaring at Hafoe, now addressed
him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou believest the gods look upon us in anger,
Hafoe? One week since, thou didst mock at our rites
in the temple, thou didst laugh at the people because
they still hold enough of the faith of their fathers to come
and worship in form, if not in spirit—with the lip, if not
with the heart.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who mocked, who laughed with me, High Priest
Oltis?” returned Hafoe, angrily.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I. And I mock and laugh still. I am not one to
change. I tell thee, Hafoe, I mocked and laughed because
I believe not. I fear no gods. I know not if there are
any!” And Oltis brought his fist down heavily upon
the small table at the head of his couch, in his defiance.</p>

<p class='c011'>The other priests shivered. Whence had come this
strange sensitiveness? Such language as that of Oltis and
Hafoe, such derision of holy things, had been heard
hourly in this inner sanctuary, and heard lightly—even
by those who could not quite steel themselves in unbelief.
But now, an indefinable dread, a strange horror,
was creeping over them as they listened. Therefore, they
looked with disapproval upon Oltis because of his defiance.
They would have rebuked his temerity, had they
dared, would have bid him incur no further displeasure
from the all too evident Unseen.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet, even as they looked with growing disfavor, did
they begin to wonder, and shortly, to stare in amaze.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>What was coming over him?</p>

<p class='c011'>Even as his hand fell had he become as it were transfixed.
The hand that lay heavily, began to press heavily;
the entire body grew in rigidity; and a deathlike pallor
was overspreading his face. Atlano, who had been gazing
alarmed, demanded:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oltis, what aileth thee? Cease that staring.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But Oltis continued to stare, and remain rigid. Fearful
was it to see his pallor, even amid this deathlike
repose, increase. Hafoe, wan and trembling, lifted his
hand from the table. But it fell a dead weight. The
eyes, in their growing glassiness, were horrible. Hafoe
cried:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oltis, dost thou live?” But not a quiver of the eyelids
answered, although the eyes lost none of their intelligence.</p>

<p class='c011'>Stonily they watched, wondering if he would come out
of this to laugh at them. Finally Atlano spoke.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oltis, cease thy spells. Wouldst thou have us as
thyself?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Upon this, the king arose stiffly, and, with some exertion,
walked beside him to gaze in his face, and feel of
his skin.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oltis, thou art a corpse, with life in it! What—aileth—thee?”</p>

<p class='c011'>But Oltis replied not save by his eloquent eyes. Every
other part of him was marble. Nervously, Atlano bade
a priest bring the life cordial. This was applied to brow
and nostrils, but had no effect. Still Oltis was as dead,
except in glance.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus, Atlano sat down. To the terrified priests who
had gathered about the stricken one, he said:</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>“Sit ye again. We will talk together—and Oltis can
listen, that is if his ears are as alive as his eyes.
Should we settle aught, such can be laid before him,
when he cometh out of this.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But they were quivering with dread, and the calm
they tried to assume, made it but the more apparent.
The voice of Hafoe shook, his words dragged feebly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“O King Atlano, let us have a care what we say!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We are here to talk upon the troubles of the day, and
to settle this matter of the Pelasgian children,” resumed
Atlano. Voice and manner had gathered assurance.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Was not the matter of the Pelasgian children settled
this day?” asked Kluto, the youngest of the priests.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was not settled;” and Atlano looked at him confidently.</p>

<p class='c011'>“King Atlano—meanest thou—that thou hast the
thought to keep them—after thy promise?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My promise to what? Kluto, believest thou in that
jugglery?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“King Atlano, thou didst seem to believe even as much
as we.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Have a care!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I mean naught save to fall before thee. But I have
the dread that the earth is about to fade away. Didst
thou note the thick, dark look of the air before we came
in here—and how gloomy was our supper room, even
with its many lights?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I did.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And, King Atlano, hast thou noted how faint is the
flame on the altar of the temple—and on this?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And these lamps in their paling?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>“I have.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then what thinkest thou of it all?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is that the air is heavier than common.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“May such not be to our woe!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We can but wait and see.” Atlano’s laugh rang
mockingly.</p>

<p class='c011'>But with his words, the priests were startled at perceiving
a change in Oltis. They pointed; and the king
looked to see him slowly raising his hand from the table.
Then it paused as if to warn.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah—he doth rouse.” And Atlano arose, and went
to him. Lightly he seized the hand, saying as if to it,
“Thou wouldst warn us—wouldst thou? Down!”</p>

<p class='c011'>But the hand, in this position, was as iron; and moved
not when Atlano, with all his strength, would have
pressed it to the table again. It remained fixed in the
air, enforcing its warning.</p>

<p class='c011'>After several trials, Atlano returned to his couch.
Very pale, but determined was his face. He said to the
trembling priests as he stood and looked his haughtiest,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why cower ye? Think ye this is also of the gods?
Think ye this will baffle me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The silent one, the only priest calm and undaunted,
arose, and looked at the king in rebuke. Atlano, unwilling
to own to himself the strange effect of this look,
struggled to shout:</p>

<p class='c011'>“And I would tell thee, ‘Silent Priest,’ that whether
thou comest of heaven or hell—thou art not to stand and
look at me thus. To thy couch! Further, turn from
me thine evil eye. Or, thou too, wilt find that, when
the king willeth, the highest in the temple, if it needeth,
shall feed the holy fire.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>The silent one stood calm, unblenching.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wilt thou to thy couch?”</p>

<p class='c011'>And King Atlano made a step forward as if he would
fall upon the man towering so grandly before him. Another
step, and he called:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Urgis, Hafoe, Sudor, Kluto—come—that we may
bring him to the earth!”</p>

<p class='c011'>But neither Urgis, Hafoe, Sudor, Kluto,—nor any
other priest—moved at his bidding. They could but
stare at this priest as he stood in his majesty and fearlessness,
could but wonder at the strange power of his
eyes. This strength of look must be what held them.
Though, why held it not Atlano, who was still advancing,
with hand stealing within his garment after his weapon,
the mysterious liquor, that had rendered Hellen impotent.</p>

<p class='c011'>Well the priests knew this liquor, for they, in their secret
laboratory, had concocted it after an almost illegible
receipt found among the possessions of the dead Viril,
who had been their instructor in alchemic arts. Well
they knew its power! Now, they awaited, in their immobility,
for its sure effect.</p>

<p class='c011'>Onward drew Atlano with gleaming eyes and stealing
hand. And, when well upon the ‘Silent Priest,’ who
still maintained his wonderful look, would have drawn
the weapon forth to fell him. But, with the significant
attempt, came dread resistance. The hand refused to
move, to come from out the folds that held it!</p>

<p class='c011'>Atlano, in his struggle to free the helpless member,
grew black in the face, black of his terror and desire for
revenge. Yet, he made as though he would still advance
upon the immovable figure, desisting only when he
found himself inert. Then did his tones ring through
the sanctuary.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>“Man—or demon—I fear thee not! I fear not thy
spells. Think not this will confound me. I say to the
voice—to those not seen—that I will not obey. I will
not yield the Pelasgian children!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then went up the cry of terror from this inner sanctuary,
from the priests so motionless before. But it was
not because of Atlano’s words. No, the earth was threatening
again. Again was smiting upon their ears the terrific
rumbling of the day before. Again was the earth
lurching as does a ship when at mercy of wind and wave.</p>

<p class='c011'>Vibration after vibration increased in such force and
velocity that it seemed the hanging lamps must come
crashing down, the walls fall in upon them. Terrible was
it to witness the statues of Amen and Poseidon sway
as though they would kiss the floor—and this continuously.
More terrible to hear Oltis’ hand fall with a loud
thud upon the table, and yet perceive that he remained
rigid and staring. Most terrible to see Atlano wrench
forth his hand, turn from the silent one, and fly to the
passage, calling after him: “Come—come—ere it be too
late!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Never had he been so well obeyed. After him sprang
the priests, Urgis leading. Scarce had the last escaped
than the ceiling yielded its lamps, which fell with terrific
noise, one almost grazing the hapless Oltis, who still sat
as iron, listening to the swift running in passages and
apartments, the shrieks that filled the air.</p>

<p class='c011'>Through the tottering temple sped all to the great
court—king, priests, handmaids, attendants—when there,
pausing to watch the temple as it swayed in the semi-darkness.
And, oh the fierce rocking of the earth beneath!
Where could they run? Not toward the ocean,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>for that was white in its threatening. Naught was left
but to fall on their knees, and utter prayers that for once
were heartfelt.</p>

<p class='c011'>The while, they watched the temple which was swaying
less and less. Would it stop, though? Incredulity
answered. But, when no longer in doubt, they fell to
embracing each other; and laughed and wept spasmodically.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then occurred another shock, a light one, that sent
them into despair. These light ones continued at short
intervals, so that they could but await the final one,
which would bring down the temple.</p>

<p class='c011'>People were thronging in to inquire as to the safety
of the temple, remaining long enough to give their experiences,
and receive those of the attendants. Meanwhile,
the king stood in his chariot near the portico surrounded
by his guards; whilst scattered about him were
priests and shrinking handmaids, the latter under strict
surveillance.</p>

<p class='c011'>Long had Atlano been looking on every side in the
gloom for the ‘Silent Priest,’ but without perceiving him.
Finally, he beckoned to Kluto. And asked, “Hast thou
seen the ‘Silent Priest’ since we fled?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“O King, I have not seen him since we sped from the
inner holy place. Then—he was lost in looking upon
Oltis—with no mind for the terrors about him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Poor Oltis! I wonder whether he hath moved,” was
said ironically. Then, with concern, he added, “Could
it be that the silent one was harmed—killed by the falling
lamps?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It might be, oh King. He seemed fixed, and with no
thought of flying.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>“I will go back, and find what hath happened to him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Gracious king, dare it not. Wait until the shocks
cease I beseech thee. Or I will go for thee.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nay—I would go. I can go in and out between
them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There would be no time to get out should the heavy
shock that we look for come whilst thou wert within.—Here
is it now!”</p>

<p class='c011'>But this proved light also. However, Atlano said, as
if to himself: “I will wait a little.—But—it doth trouble
me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus, he fidgeted, and looked most anxious. And at
last whispered to Urgis, who stood at his right, “Well
would it be if the silent one were lying stark—stiffer
than Oltis!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Gracious king, have a care.”—Urgis looked in fear
about him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am having a care—a care for myself—for all of us.
While he liveth, I cannot breathe. Of that, am I sure.
Ah—to see him on the altar!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then, because of Urgis’ terrified look, he laughed
recklessly. And subjoined:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wonder how are the queen and her children. At
eve, when I asked after the sleeping one, I was told that
herself and Electra were fastened within the inner room
of the queen, where they were resting. Even the queen
denied me, being therein also. In meek manner did I
come away. But this day—that now is beginning—will
they learn the power of the king!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Again he laughed recklessly. Though Urgis and the
others hearing this laugh could but shudder.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XIII.<br /> <span class='large'>IN THE ‘DEEPS.’</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>As Kluto said, the ‘Silent Priest’ had remained in the
inner sanctuary to gaze upon Oltis who still showed no
life save in the eyes, that of his agony, were almost
bursting from their sockets.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet alas for Oltis—the greatest shock was to come.
His humiliation and despair were not complete.</p>

<p class='c011'>When the fleeing priests were without, the ‘Silent
Priest’ moved nearer; and standing over him, severe in
his majesty, gave utterance to speech. Fearful was it to
hear his deep tones in the gruesome apartment, but more
fearful to witness the great beads that started upon Oltis’
forehead at sound of this voice.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yea, Oltis—I can speak when I will. The time hath
come. I have to say I go from thee for a little. I would
look into the hidden things of the ‘Deeps.’ Then will I
come back.”</p>

<p class='c011'>In Oltis’ eyes was a look of utmost horror, and
the perspiration rolled off him. Yet he stirred not—even
when the ‘Silent Priest’ after lighting a hand lamp,
had left the apartment to penetrate those mysteries which
had been supposed so artfully veiled.</p>

<p class='c011'>Deucalion entered the passage dividing the withdrawing
rooms of Atlano, Oltis, and Urgis. Unheedful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>of the lavish luxury disclosed by the open doors, on he
hastened, his eyes, his thoughts intent upon a door at the
end that was set low in the wall.</p>

<p class='c011'>Reaching this, he pressed the lower left hand corner.
There was heard the sound of something smoothly moving.
The door was disappearing within the wall, disclosing
a stone stairway extending into darkness.</p>

<p class='c011'>Lamp in hand, he darted down this to come upon two
doors side by side. He pressed upon the lower right
hand corner of the left one; and it yielded, gliding into
the wall about the other which was but an imitation.</p>

<p class='c011'>As though blinded, he stepped through.</p>

<p class='c011'>When the film had cleared from his eyes, he beheld
spreading deep, a vast, crypt-like apartment whose high
ceiling was supported by pillars of red syenite; and about
which were burning lamps securely fastened in niches.
The walls were covered with a coating of lime so smooth
that the figures painted thereon in rich colors and quite
elegantly, stood out in fine relief.</p>

<p class='c011'>As these figures treated of the gods and the future life,
Deucalion would have been glad to study them, had the
occasion allowed. As it was, he but glanced at them;
and then his eyes darted from point to point. Almost
instantly, at the farther end, where the shadows were
thickest, they lighted upon some indistinct white objects,
that moved with every vibration of the still rocking
building.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a terrible moment for Deucalion. Over him
swept a mighty dread—a dread to go nearer these. Yet,
stifling this, he began to run down the long apartment,
tottering as he ran. And came beside these large white
objects—that proved to be beautifully sculptured coffins
of alabaster, mounted on great blocks of red syenite.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>In the extreme of weakness, he fell against the first;
and moaned; and implored for courage to look within.</p>

<p class='c011'>And arousing, did so—to weep and groan, to run like
a madman from one to the other until he had looked in
all.</p>

<p class='c011'>For, here were no priests in these alabaster coffins.
Instead, were the embalmed bodies of what had been
fair maidens—each with a lifetime of woe upon its
features. Such haggardness, such suffering, surely never
before were stamped on young faces. So fine was the
embalming that every line showed as in life—and with
its weight of agony.</p>

<p class='c011'>He ran from one to the other, crying, “Ye powers—could
such things be? Their poor bodies tell the tale.
The pretty ones—the tortured ones! Ah—those thrice-cursed
monsters! Yet they live—live to gloat upon their
work. Ye gods—crush them out. Never again let such
work mar the face of earth. Æole, Æole—to see what
was before thee!”</p>

<p class='c011'>He fell on his knees, the tears streaming, and besought:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mercy, ye gods! Help! Set us free from this house
of death! (Ye vile islanders—to lose these fair ones—and
not pull down this pile!) Help me, ye gods, to save my
dear ones. And give Electra, too. Aid me still to master
king, priests, people, until I am on the sea, and bearing
my dear ones to Pelasgia. Ah, Æole, Hellen—what
sorrow is like unto this?”</p>

<p class='c011'>He arose; and ran again, as if distracted, from coffin to
coffin.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ye pretty ones! Where were your fathers—your
mothers? Was it for this ye were given them? Do the
gods grant that men may live lost to all save sense, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>die in peace in such? Never! Thrice-cursed island,
thou art doomed! Thou and thy vile people will vanish
as down blown by the wind! And coming ages will
doubt thy being; or, if not doubting, will mock at thee!”</p>

<p class='c011'>When he had turned from the last coffin, and was
staggering about aimlessly, he came upon a door set low
under the stairway. “Ah,” he muttered, “I know. It
leadeth to the embalming room—the private one of these
priests. Well know they the art—as these tortured ones
show.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He hastened to this door, and pushed it open. Here
again was darkness. He went for his lamp; and then
stepped through into a low passage; and thence through
another door into a very large apartment. As he had
surmised, it was the private embalming room.</p>

<p class='c011'>With lamp held high, he walked in its fell shadows,
examining. Here was the crooked piece of iron for
drawing out the brain through the nostrils. Here was
the Ethiopian stone for making the incision in the side.
There were the palm wine, the powdered myrrh, the cassia,
the other aromatic drugs. There were the bandages
of linen, the gum, the natron, even the cinnamon. And—yes—there
in the most distant corner—were more of
those pure, translucent alabaster coffins. Empty—waiting
for whom?</p>

<p class='c011'>The apartment was shaken with his groans. He felt
if he staid longer his senses would give way. Wildly he
ran back into the vault, and toward the stairway. His
soul was filled with horror. His eyeballs burned. His
body shook as if with palsy. So overcome was he that,
on the topmost step, he fell panting. And could not
rise for many minutes. When he did, it was to totter to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>the inner sanctuary. Here he fell on a couch, groaning
repeatedly.</p>

<p class='c011'>Finally, his strength returning, he went over to Oltis,
and said, “I have been down the stairway.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Over the marble figure passed a tremor.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have seen the dead handmaids in their alabaster
coffins!”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was another tremor.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Whose work was this?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The marble lips moved.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was that of Atlano and myself.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“This was in thy base search for that draught said to
give life without end? To get this, thou hast tortured
those fair young creatures?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yea. And the younger and fairer, the more the
power,” burst from Oltis. “Viril knew! Viril found it
out for his own use! But was so base as not to tell us!—Though,
among his goods, we found a torn piece of
papyrus that gave us the clue. On it was written some
of the parts forming the draught. The blood of maidens—lovely
maidens—was one. And, as their blood
dripped from them into the crucible, they were to stand
and stir the blessed mixture. Ah, how we worked! How
we tried to find the missing parts. Maiden after maiden
lost her life!” Oltis had become gloating in his remembrance.
“And if, at times, Atlano would have had mercy,
I would not. His mercy, thou canst judge. As for myself,
no maiden was so fair as the one, who, in her mixing,
most promised the draught. For, there is power in
maiden blood! Once, we almost reached it. Once, I
believed I should be High Priest—King, forever! But
it came to naught.” And his head sank on his breast.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>“They died then?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yea. Their blood was their life!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“This was done in the room yonder?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Deucalion had pointed to a door at the northwestern
corner.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yea.” Oltis again raised his head;—his eyes were
resuming their savageness. “Since thou camest—for
some reason—we have not had the wish.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then—why came Æole into this inner place?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ask me not.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah—Æole—my child—my child!” cried Deucalion,
involuntarily. And he fell on his knees to utter his gratitude.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thanks, ye gods! Thanks that I came in time.
Thanks for these powers that have aided me to this. Ah—Æole—Hellen—to
have you again in Pelasgia. To
bring you to the arms of your mother!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Most terrible was the cry that burst from Oltis. In
his horror at this, sudden revelation, he started to his feet—but
only to sink to his couch, helpless. Untold agony
was upon him. Light had come that was paralyzing,
blinding. Groan after groan rent his stiffened body.</p>

<p class='c011'>Deucalion arose to gaze at him; and quickly he calmed
almost to stupor. Then Deucalion questioned him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where got ye the coffins?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They were made in Khemi;<a id='r20'></a><a href='#f20' class='c012'><sup>[20]</sup></a> and brought into the
vault in the darkest night.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Doth Kluto know aught of this?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He knoweth not. He was raised to this inner holy
place as thou camest. He hath not been told.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>“The other higher priests know?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They know, and aided, hoping for the draught. In
the temples of all the great cities are the priests seeking.
I have been among them.” Here was a sigh that had
terrible meaning.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The rulers, like the king, have aided?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yea.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is the reason the captains meet no more?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yea.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is the reason the sixth year was not kept?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That was the year before thou camest. We had not
the time.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“O most wretched people! With all thine ease, there
is now no time for the keeping of thine oldest law, one
handed down by thy father Poseidon! How couldst
thou dare to let the sixth year go by, Oltis?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I care not for the olden laws. Thinkest thou because
such are graved on their columns that they must stand
forever? We can make laws now for ourselves; and
have.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Deucalion shivered.</p>

<p class='c011'>This violation in not observing the sixth year was
most heinous. The first men had inscribed its regulations
on the great column of orichalcum, before mentioned,
that stood in the grove of Poseidon in front of
the gateway of the great court. Here, before this column,
were the king and sub-kings (or royal rulers),
to meet every fifth and sixth year alternately, in order
to consult about public affairs, inquire into weighty transgressions,
and afterward pass judgment. It was a grand
Congress. But before judgment was passed, certain
pledges were given, and in this wise:</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>The sacred bulls that ranged the inclosures on the
northern slope of the mountain were hunted by ten
chosen men with staves and nooses. When one was
caught, he was led up to the column, and struck upon
the head to fall dead before the inscription. Then, on
the altar near the column, were his limbs offered a burnt
sacrifice. Afterward, a cup was partly filled with his
blood; and in this, each one of the Congress cast a
blood clot. Then the rest of the victim was laid on the
fire. Thereupon, each took a golden vessel, drew from
the cup, and poured a libation upon the fire, at the same
time swearing that he would punish transgressors, that
he would not violate the inscriptions, and that he would
not obey any ruler who would command him to act contrary
to the laws of Poseidon. After drinking, each vessel
was dedicated to the temple.</p>

<p class='c011'>When supper was eaten, and the altar fire was out,
they put on beautiful azure robes; and sat in the darkness
before the embers of the sacrifice in order to receive
and give judgment. At daybreak were written on golden
tablets their sentences, which were then deposited in the
temple as memorials, together with the robes.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the end, they swore not to take up arms against
each other; ever to aid the royal house in case of rebellion;
and, in common, to deliberate upon war, giving the
supremacy to the house of Atlas. Further, the king
promised never to decide upon the life or death of a
kinsman unless he had the assent of a majority of the
sub-kings.<a id='r21'></a><a href='#f21' class='c012'><sup>[21]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>This was the most ancient and most important of
observances. Yet rulers and priests had combined to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>neglect it—whilst the people looked on. No wonder
was it that Deucalion shivered.</p>

<p class='c011'>Upon recovering somewhat, he exclaimed: “Oltis, it
is the crowning crime!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We have not lost through it. Let not thy mind be
weighted.” Scornful was his tone.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oltis, I am borne to earth. Yet will I rise that I
may bring the people to the ‘Deeps’—there to behold
thy work—there to open their eyes—shouldst thou not
do as I bid thee.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The figure again growing into marble shuddered.
Great beads of perspiration started. But no words came.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oltis, when day breaketh, thou wilt go with me to
the portico, and tell the people this: That the powers
above will that the Pelasgian children leave with me at
once. A few words will do. Else—”</p>

<p class='c011'>The marble again quivered; the lips murmured, “I
will.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Deucalion sat down before the wretched man, and
pondered.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Those who pressed within this inner holy place yesterday,
may have noted that there were no signs of the
missing handmaids. And, of this, the people may have
been told. They should, then, be more than ever in
doubt as to their present place—unless they are dead of
all feeling.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Though, what else can come of a people who can
bear such mockeries, who break the marriage laws, who
wed within forbidden limits, who are given over to
feasting, drinking, pleasuring; who think no longer of
raising higher the mind, but only of delighting the body;
and yet, who, in the midst of all, daily see and touch
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>monuments that speak with force of past virtue, of a
worship once most pure.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Should these islanders be brought in to see the sight
below, it would not help. For the island is doomed.
Not long could these evils last even if the islanders
should still be as stone, after seeing. And any trouble
now, will but hinder our going.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have it. I will write what I have seen; and ere
leaving, will send it to the people of Chimo. They are
the best and strongest of these islanders. Yea that will
I do. It may help the handmaids, should the doom of
the island be stayed a little.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But, ah, this strange inner sight, why faileth it? Why,
for many days, hath it left me, so that I know not if
Pyrrha liveth. Yet, why should I doubt, after what I
have felt and seen? Sure am I that she liveth. Sure
am I that, in the end, joy will be ours. Yet am I weak—weak!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Whilst thus Deucalion mused and suffered, the day
broke. With the first entering rays of the sun, Oltis
stirred; and gradually shook off the now willing iron
bands. Shortly he arose, but only to fall back of his
weakness. Then Deucalion gave him of the life cordial,
after mixing with it a few drops of a red elixir. Thereupon,
Oltis arose, and stretched as if arousing from sleep.
Some minutes afterward, he was walking about unsteadily.
And Deucalion waited a little.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oltis, lean upon me. We will go to the portico.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He complied. Sad was it to see the docility of this
hitherto proud and intractable man. As they walked,
Deucalion spoke low:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Say but the words that will speed the children and
myself on our way to Pelasgia.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>“I know thee, at last, strange man,” was returned wearily.
“But what knowledge! Ah, if Atlano but knew!
Even as it is—how hath he longed for thy blood. And—to
find—thou art—Deucalion!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“This knowledge must be thine alone. He is not to
know.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will be dumb. But how hast thou mastered us.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will master you—when, with the children, I am on
the sea, and facing Pelasgia.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How didst thou get such power? Are there gods?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oltis, there are. Know sorrow for thy sin, ere it be
too late.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I cannot. Of what use is such sorrow? It would
come only of fear. Should the fear be no more, I would
be as I have been.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou speakest truth. Sorrow for sin should come
of the heart alone. But that may be thine. Sorrow thus
for warmth to the gods.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sir Deucalion, I know no warmth of feeling. I never
knew such for aught of earth—not even for my children.
How then could I know it for the gods, if such there be?
I tell thee if there is a life beyond, I am doomed.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Say not so, Oltis. If one spark of feeling could begin
to glow in thy heart, it would spread, giving heat,
life to all the inner man—wouldst thou grant it air. Faint
though the spark, it groweth with little feeding.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Oltis sighed; then said, “I could strangle thee, now,
had I the power. That is my spark of feeling! To be
thus humbled, weakened! Oh, but to have my fingers
about thy neck, to see thine eyes burst from thy head, to
fix that head on a pillar in the air, to watch the birds of
prey gather its flesh, mite by mite! How I ache! How
I pant for thy blood!”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>“Have done,” spoke Deucalion sternly, “or worse will
befall thee than thou dreamest. Wouldst thou be given
over to the tender mercy of the people?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will do that I am forced to. But—for one moment
of freedom!” Dreadful were his writhings.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Calm thyself. We are almost at the portal.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And, at the portal they were—most suddenly to come
out before the watching islanders.</p>

<p class='c011'>The sun was just above the horizon when the shouts
arose, “The High Priest!” “The ‘Silent Priest’!” “Behold!”
“Behold!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Atlano, who was talking with Urgis, turned; and perceived
the two standing on the portico. Intense chagrin
was expressed in his face as he gazed and wondered.
The ‘Silent Priest’ not killed! But, instead, thus appearing,—bearing
up Oltis who was trembling as an aged
man. “What meant it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>But the high priest was beckoning. In answer, the
people surged forward. When there was quiet, Oltis
spoke.</p>

<p class='c011'>“King Atlano, Priests, People, these troubles are of
the gods. Anger them no further. Hearken to this,
their will. Ere the morn is two hours older will the
Pelasgian children leave, and with the ‘Silent Priest.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>Atlano’s derisive laugh burst forth. But the people
began to cry their acquiescence. It was:</p>

<p class='c011'>“So shall it be!” “So shall it be!” “We will be rid of
them!” “They are a scourge!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The guards encircling Atlano appeared alarmed. Already
they were fearing some manifestation against him.
But he, with wonderful coolness, replied to Oltis, “How
are we to believe that the gods thus will?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>“In like manner as the people believed that, at will of
the gods, the handmaids were forced into the inner holy
place—never to be seen more!” Loud rang the imperial
voice, seeming to be thrown from high above.</p>

<p class='c011'>Atlano paled in a terrible way. Many of the priests
fell on their faces. The people groaned, and pressed
about the guards so that the latter were forced to point
their spears and raise their battle axes. And, oh the
sullen discomfiture smoldering in some eyes, the menacing
lightning ready to dart from others!</p>

<p class='c011'>But Atlano was brave. He spoke again, with boldness,
“Oltis, go within. Thou art feeble, too feeble, to
stand there. Thy mind giveth way—as hath thy body.
Go within.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Oltis indeed proved the weakness of his body by falling
against the ‘Silent Priest,’ who lifted him, and bore
him inside, after signifying that he would return.</p>

<p class='c011'>When Oltis had been laid upon his couch in the inner
sanctuary, the ‘Silent Priest’ reappeared before the ominously
quiet people, and signed that he would at once
depart, recommended them to the mercy of the gods,
blessed them, and bade farewell.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then to Sensel, who was near, he delivered a roll of
papyrus addressed to the queen.</p>

<p class='c011'>As for Atlano, he felt it was policy to be quiescent.
After the besotted conduct of Oltis, there was no knowing
what might happen. As to the voice, he would
still disclaim it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then, as the ground was resting of its tremors, he
ordered the guards to disperse the excited, awakening
islanders. When the great court was quite emptied, he
entered the temple to seek Oltis that he might upbraid
him for his faint-heartedness.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>Speedily he was beside the wretched high priest, who
lay with closed eyes, scarcely breathing: though not a
word was vouchsafed to all his questions and vituperations.
Thus, as a resource, he bethought him of the
queen and her charges; and, returning to the courtyard,
called his guards, and drove to the palace.</p>

<p class='c011'>As he passed along, much the people marveled. Never
before had a king of Atlantis been known to require protection
in driving between the temple and the palace.
Attendants, of course, were customary;—but guards!
What meant such a passing as this?</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XIV.<br /> <span class='large'>A TIMELY TORRENT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Queen Atlana and her young charges were finishing
a hurried meal in the most delightful of morning rooms.
This was in the east garden, and had for floor, velvety
grass; for ceiling, the interlacing boughs of two fragrant
acacias; for background, a trellis overrun with morning-glories
and flanked at each end by tall white lilies and the
high blue shoots of the papyrus.</p>

<p class='c011'>Further the favorite lotus flowers spread thick on the
bosom of a stream to the eastward that was running
blithely to lose itself in the beautiful Luith. Flowers,
flowers were everywhere; for this was their land. And
those of the trellis in their white, pink, blue, crimson, and
purple, were preëminent for size and tint.</p>

<p class='c011'>Who, with any spirituality, can look upon these thick-clustering
morning-glories as they open joyfully to the
morning sun, and not think of a higher blossoming? In
their delicate texture, and soft rich coloring, they suggest
the flowers of Heaven. Their ethereal loveliness fills the
heart with a most tender rapture. Fit types are they of
that fairer blooming of the Uplands, to which the eye has
not yet pierced, to which the ear is yet unopened!</p>

<p class='c011'>The grand eating apartment, or banqueting room, was
in the western wing of the palace, and facing the south.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>But the breakfast room proper faced the east, and overlooked
this garden morning room, the latter superseding
the former for about three-fourths of the year, from the
tenderness of the climate.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the simplicity of their diet and table service, the
Atlanteans might be held an example. Theirs were no
cumbersome, broad tables weighed down with plate and
ornamentations. The dishes and drinking vessels were
of gold, silver, bronze, or tin, as accorded with the degree
of the family using; and were of simplest pattern and
beaten light, the spiral being the principal adornment.
There were spiral handles, and spiral supports to the
larger dishes, also. As to the tables, they were hollow,
either broken circles or horseshoes in shape, and of three
feet in width—of course affording seating capacity on
the outer side only. Thus, well could the Atlanteans
arrange for effective backgrounds, well could they be
served. Further, such waitresses were theirs! Through
the openings of these broken circles, or horseshoes, flitted
beauteous maidens, white-robed and garlanded, who
could but whet the appetite. Maidens ever served in
Atlantis. Clever people!</p>

<p class='c011'>In the middle of her table, sat Queen Atlana, with
Æole on the right, and Electra on the left; while, farther
along the broken circle, on either side, ranged her
ladies. For this morning, there was a visitor—Hellen;
and his place was at the end, on the queen’s right.</p>

<p class='c011'>All were facing the garden, and the sun which was
well up; and feeling happily conscious of the fairy-like
background, the soft singing stream, the warblers in the
acacia blooms overhead, and the lovely gliding maidens
attending their few wants.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>Three feet was the space allotted each at the table;
and the dividing lines were rows of flowers extending
crosswise, flowers of scent so delicate that they could
not interfere with the appetite of the most sensitive.</p>

<p class='c011'>Fancy a breakfast of eggs, milk, honey, dried birds,
fruit, and cakes made of corn and honey—ye epicures.
Well would it be could ye more than fancy. Well would
it be for your poor, ill-treated organs!</p>

<p class='c011'>But, upon this sensible, paradisiacal breakfast was stealing
the serpent. Through the garden was approaching
Atlano, though not with the soft, quick gliding of the
animal mentioned, but with infuriated stride. However,
as the serpent is the symbol of sense, the comparison will
hold.</p>

<p class='c011'>And the happy eyes of the eaters fell as one upon him!
For, they were happy, in spite of what had been undergone,
in spite of the parting to come. They were happy
in being together.</p>

<p class='c011'>Very calmly, cheerfully did the queen arise to meet
him as he drew near, though his scowling looks were
sufficient to have chilled the stoutest heart. However, in
response to her salutation, he forced a smile; and bowed
to the others, who, following the queen’s example, had
also arisen and saluted him.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then he said, in questioning tone, “Ye are early at the
morning meal.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yea, Atlano. But—for very good cause.” Rather
faltering was the queen’s reply.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have not broken fast since this troubled night.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come, then; and be strengthened.” With the words,
Atlana motioned him to the seat relinquished by Æole.
Quite tractably he took this, and was permitting the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>maidens to serve him, when his eyes fell upon Hellen, who
was standing beside Æole and Electra, and talking fast.</p>

<p class='c011'>Direful was the anger that showed in his face; and this
smote upon the queen. Though she tried to talk with
ease as he grew even angrier, seeming with every morsel
to choke the more. Finally, unable to restrain himself,
he demanded in what is known as a stage undertone,
“Why is Hellen here—and at this meal?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is his last morning, as thou knowest.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know it not.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They leave this day.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have not said the word.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou hast promised.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I meant it not.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We have made ready.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That doth not matter.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then perceiving that the three had ceased their talking,
and were watching him, he beckoned, and said, “Æole,
come hither.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She, with the others, approached.</p>

<p class='c011'>He arose from his scanty meal, and in softened tone,
inquired:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Æole, wouldst thou be glad to leave us?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Gracious King, I would be glad to go to my home;
but am loth to leave Queen Atlana.” The lovely face
had become downcast.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But Pelasgia is not so far,” interposed the queen.
“And we have good vessels. How strong is my wish to
journey thither with thee, Æole, and place thee in the
arms of thy mother!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Much good would the vessels do thee, Atlana,” said
the king with meaning. “It is not for thee to go so far.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>“I forgot.” She laughed in a sorrowful way. “Too
well I know the need of my presence to the king!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And thou, Electra, what wilt thou do when Æole
hath left us?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“King Atlano, I will live in the hope of meeting her,
if even in Pelasgia.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We will come for thee, Electra,” spoke Hellen. “Pelasgia
will not be Pelasgia—nor my mother, mother—nor
my father, father—without thee. Where thou art is the
home for me. Rather would I stay here than go from
thee to the brightest fate!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hush, Hellen!” Poor Electra was trying hard to
bear up.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Through the night and this morning have I wavered
between my home and thee. Now is my mind clear!”
And Hellen looked about him, fierce in his determination.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Trouble thyself no longer, Hellen. Thou wilt never
go back. Neither will Æole. I have need of thee, of
her. Thou forgettest the pain in store for thee. I am
not done with that. Never spoke Atlantean to king as
hast thou, the stranger, the captive. This island may
sink ere I forget it!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The king was working himself into fury again. The
listeners stood petrified, all but the queen. She spoke
out with fine spirit:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Atlano, I have this to tell thee. It hath been sent
me that they are to go. A little after daybreak came the
word. Since then my serving men have been making
ready. I must tell thee,”—and she spoke faster,—“that
I have ordered my galley. And another galley is making
ready with food and drink for the use of Hellen and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>Æole. The two galleys are to sail down Luith to the
coast, and up along that until they meet the ‘Silent
Priest’ who will come in his boat.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where gottest thou all this?” stammered the king.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Didst thou not know? There came the written word
from the ‘Silent Priest’ scarce an hour since. Sensel
brought it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Here is fine doing,” vociferated he. “And thou to
obey! Art thou, like Oltis, becoming weak of mind?
Art thou crazed?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“If to be crazed is to wish well to Æole and Hellen,
if to be crazed is to wish to see them well away from this
island, if to be crazed is to wish to obey that grand priest—then
that I am.” Drawing herself up, she looked at
him with such brave eyes that he, in fear for what she
might next say, temporized:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Atlana, thou must know—everything hath gone
wrong since this meddling priest set foot on the sands.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Have a care, King Atlano.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, the fiery Electra speaketh. So, he is a favorite
of thine.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He is. Better, he is the worker of the gods. That
is why things have gone wrong, as thou callest it. Thy
wrong meaneth right on the other side. There are two
sides to all things.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This was dreadful, but such was the force of example.
If the queen would demean herself by speaking her mind,
what could be expected of underlings. He glared
from the rather aghast Atlana to this rebellious Electra,
and said, as if hurling a weapon, “This, thy worker
of the gods, is to come down from his height. Ere
the day closeth, will he be yielded upon the altar!”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>“Beware,” came from Hellen. And he made a step
forward.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha! Now it is the rash Hellen of ready tongue.
Boy, thou art not in Pelasgia.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But soon will be.” Then his crest lowered, for he
thought of Electra.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hellen,” urged the queen, “better would it be if thou
didst not speak.” Then to the king, she said appealingly,
“Atlano, of a truth, the galleys wait for us. Let
us to them. As thou goest, it may be that thou wilt
look with other eyes upon this.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Never will I look with other eyes. But I will go
with thee to make this naught.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Make it not naught, King Atlano,” interposed Æole,
to the amazement of all, even himself. Never before had
she been known to address him. “Make not naught our
going. The heart of Queen Atlana is in this. Let not
her hopes come to naught. And, anger not the gods.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hearken unto her, Atlano,” entreated the queen.
“Let them go. Further, grant that I may go a short
way with them. And come thou on this little sail.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Atlano was looking into the beautiful, starry eyes that
were even more eloquent than the sweet tones. And,
most suddenly, felt like giving way. But, checking the
impulse, he replied, as if to Atlana,</p>

<p class='c011'>“However willing I may be for thee to enjoy thy ‘little
sail,’ I may not grant it for strong reason. Thou
knowest why.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Atlano, I will be gone but half the day. If thou wilt
bring to mind, thou wert willing I should go to Chimo,
and stay for days, not long since.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then skies were fair, and the gods smiling. But, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>take it, these late troubles make of need thy presence
here.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Atlano, once thou didst laugh at that prophecy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then I was young, and not so wicked.” He laughed
recklessly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of a truth, a stay so short cannot work evil.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Atlana, thy words seem as though I had said this
thing could be. Talk no more of it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Gracious King,” urged Æole, again to the surprise of
all, “shouldst thou say the word, and then come with
us, thou art with the queen.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Æole, the prophecy doth run, ‘<i>With Atlana at the
palace, no evil befalleth Atlano.</i>’ Wouldst thou have her
go, did I grant it, after this?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nay, King Atlano, not if it doth run thus.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Æole, thou dost yield too soon,” cried Electra, in her
annoyance. “What are twenty prophecies to thy getting
away!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, it is Electra again,” sneered Atlano, “the lady
of the tongue.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I bless heaven for my tongue if it doth wage for the
right. So may all women. Only cowards or tyrants
need fear the tongues of honest women; and of their fear
they rail.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And thou, it seemeth, hast had the hope of sharing
in this ‘little sail.’ Will this help thee to it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The gods will help me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The gods, it seemeth, are thy very good friends.”
And, oh his mocking tone!</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well would it be were they thy friends, King Atlano.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Her eyes held more meaning even than her solemn
tones. As if to ignore both, he turned to address Æole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>just as an attendant came from behind the trellis with the
message that the galleys were in readiness. Then the
ladies Rica and Elna who had gone within, reappeared,
robed for the trip and bearing the queen’s wraps as well
as those of Æole and Electra.</p>

<p class='c011'>When Atlana’s mantle was placed about her, she addressed
the king: “Now are we ready to go to the galleys—if
it needeth to see them off—if it needeth to go
with them a little. Say but the word, Atlano.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He replied not. She continued, “Come. And thou,
Æole, walk on this side. Electra, thou wilt follow with
Hellen. Rica and Elna, ye will lead.—Where is Azu?”</p>

<p class='c011'>For answer, there was heard a sound as of a falling
body. All turned knowing what this meant, knowing
they should behold Azu flat on his face. This was ever
the manner in which he testified his knowledge of the
presence of the king. And there he was, prone in front
of the trellis, behind which he had been awaiting call.</p>

<p class='c011'>Even Atlano laughed. Then, as usual, he gave the
word to arise, which Azu did in sprightly fashion, to
stand grinning and bowing, and showing only the whites
of his great round eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come, Azu,” said the queen. “Thou wilt hold up
my robe.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Azu lurched to this; and held up the train tenderly.
The queen continued, “Now will we go.”</p>

<p class='c011'>In this order, was the reluctant king borne through
the garden, and on to the landing place. With scowling
eyes fastened on the ground, he pondered as to the words
he should speak upon arriving there. And no speech
would he vouchsafe by the way.</p>

<p class='c011'>Hellen and Electra, naturally, fell a little behind.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>When well beyond hearing, Hellen said low, “Electra,
the king will never give the word.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hellen, the king will give the word.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou art as full of hope as of strength. How didst
thou come by a spirit so light?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Always hath it been mine. Never have I known
fear.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But, of late thou hast known it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nay. Though I lost hope when I believed Æole had
passed away. How I prayed to go to her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hadst thou no thought for me—for my double sorrow?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hellen, I did think of thee. I knew thou wouldst
sorrow much. But further, I knew it would not be for
long. Thou wouldst have come to us. And what joy
to be in the other life together!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Had I thy hope.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now shouldst thou have it if ever.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It cometh. Electra, hearken. I hug to myself that
which even Æole knoweth not. Who, thinkest thou, is
the ‘Silent Priest’?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“One sent of the gods.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But who—what person is he?”</p>

<p class='c011'>She looked at him keenly, and noted his excitement.—“Thou
meanest not—that he cometh from Pelasgia?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But I do—he cometh from there.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It cannot be that—he is—thy father?” Her voice
had sunk to an awed whisper.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Electra, thou readest my mind. Yea, yea, he is my
father, that father I have so doubted. Thou canst imagine
a little my shame, my sorrow. But I have told him,
and he hath said that he doth know—that it was but in
nature. Such is his grand heart.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>Electra had paused, and was breathing hard. For the
first time in her life, words refused to come. Thus Hellen
went on.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yea, and this is his plan for saving us. His wisdom
hath caused these wonders—all save the quakings of the
earth, and the voice. In Pelasgia, so much of hidden
knowledge was his that the people called him the ‘favorite
of the gods.’ And the gods are with him now.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But—the voice—Hellen?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The voice—ah, that is Sensel.” And he enlightened
her. For the moment she stood motionless; and then
seizing his arm that they might hasten on, murmured:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou, Hellen, to further doubt! It is past belief.
Help me to believe.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Electra, where now is thy surety?” laughed he gaily
and fondly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is right, Hellen. Turn upon me. I merit it
after making naught thy words.” She smiled bewitchingly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Turn upon thee, I will! If the king sayeth the word
for us to go, thou wilt see such a turning upon, shouldst
thou not be of us. I will turn away from them to thee.
Thus will I turn upon thee. Never will I leave thee!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Hard was it for Electra to bear up under this. And
more might follow. Hellen would do the wildest, rashest
things, without doubt; for this reason she must divert
his thoughts.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think when the thought cometh to one as strong as
it did to me, during last night, that we should this day go
sailing from Atlantis, it meaneth much. It meaneth we
shall go. But what a drear night was this last, Hellen.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was spent with thee and Æole. Therefore, was it
bright.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>There was danger again. Fortunately, a turn in the
garden brought them in sight of the landing place,
where the others of the party were pausing, with faces
turned toward them expectantly. Thus, they quickened
their pace.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the marble landing place awaited the two galleys,
gay in their bright-colored awnings and hangings; whilst
hovering about, were other galleys belonging to the palace
and the neighboring nobles. The queen’s galley,
the smaller of the two, was built of cedar, and its sides
were ornamented in ebony and gold. It had but one
mast, whose sail was of the costly byssus. The hangings
and awnings were also of byssus, white, and richly
embroidered in pale blue and corn color. The deck was
inlaid with fine woods; and in the middle was the withdrawing
room. This was built of satin wood, and paneled
within in sandalwood; and was furnished with
rugs, couches, tables, and chairs, all luxurious. On
either side of this apartment, were stretched awnings,
beneath which were more rugs and couches.</p>

<p class='c011'>The other galley was arranged much like the queen’s,
but was not so luxurious in its appointments, or lavish
in its hangings. Evidently it was built for use. Scattered
about its deck were baskets of provisions; whilst
near the prow was a shallow hold, also containing baskets,
and jars large and small. The withdrawing room
had doors instead of hangings. The one sail was square,
large, and of strong linen colored blue. Indeed, there
was an air about this galley indicating it meant work.
Thus, the eyes were attracted toward it full as much as
toward the elegant one of the queen.</p>

<p class='c011'>The figurehead of the queen’s galley was a bust of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>Amen; that of Hellen’s, a bust of Poseidon. Both
flaunted banners bearing the symbol of Atlantis, a cross
surrounded by a circle,<a id='r22'></a><a href='#f22' class='c012'><sup>[22]</sup></a> in gold. From each, many
pennants were flying symbolic of Poseidon’s arrival on
the island and his meeting with Cleito, the symbols being
wrought in gold upon a blue ground.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of the sailors, or oarsmen belonging, a few were at
the oars; but the greater number were on the decks of
the neighboring galleys.</p>

<p class='c011'>Overhead, the sky was welcoming the beauteous Aurora
who was now treading securely on her way. The
hush, the glow, the heavenliness of young morn was
upon all; and a little of its peace fell upon the spirits of
the queen and her young charges, so that they stood silent,
for the moment; giving inward, upward voice to
their yearnings, and finding hope.</p>

<p class='c011'>O East, with thy potent beams! It was for reason
that the most ancient nations looked in thy direction for
the especial Divine presence! It was for reason that
their temples faced thee, their altars were placed toward
thee; that they themselves, when bending the knee,
looked to thee! For reason was it that the Star was
set in thee, that the wise men journeyed—of their knowledge—toward
thee and It!</p>

<p class='c011'>Already, on this bright morn, were the islanders forgetting
their terrors of the night. Banks of canal and
stream were lined with them, for they of their curiosity,
were awaiting what the king would do. Would he obey
the voices of the past few days? Would he fulfill his
promises to the Unseen? Would the queen show herself
when her young charges were to leave?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>And now,—here she was! Surely the king was about
to make good his promises. With keenest expectation,
they waited until the queen should look a little about
her. Then, they shouted their love. She, deeply
touched, bowed again and again; and smiled rarely.</p>

<p class='c011'>But, there were no welcoming voices for the king; and
the queen felt a culprit that she had received all. Meanwhile,
Atlano had affected to be observing the galleys,
such affectation giving place to interest until his dark
face grew darker. Not long was he in bursting forth:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good work was this. And in an hour! Whom
didst thou get—of these slow Atlanteans to manage
this?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sensel ran much—and helped in the bearing.” The
queen’s tone was meekness itself.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He is the spawn of evil,” vociferated Atlano, regardless
who might hear. “And his fitting master is that
‘Silent Priest.’ I tell thee, Atlana, it is they have
brought these evils upon us. I am more than ever sure
it is their presence that doth anger Amen. Now I again
say—and before you all—that Hellen and Æole shall not
go. Then for some fine gifts on the altar with the morrow.
The gods would thus order! Ha—ha!”</p>

<p class='c011'>He looked a demon. Queen Atlana became gray in
her terror, and clasped Æole to her. Hellen, freeing
himself from Electra’s detaining grasp, was about to dart
upon him when prevented in a manner as unexpected as
appalling.</p>

<p class='c011'>They were standing on a marble terrace beside a placid
stream, beneath a smiling sky, and about them were
heard the murmurings of the listening islanders. But,
in an instant, came dread change. The sky darkened
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>to blackness; great raindrops splashed down; and a
shower succeeded that flooded the terrace in a moment.
Further, wildest cries of terror arose from the fleeing
islanders seeking cover.</p>

<p class='c011'>Panic seized upon those on the landing place. They
flew down the stairway to the shelter of the larger galley—Atlano
leading and helping. Into the withdrawing
room they sped, to close the doors, and drop upon the
couches.</p>

<p class='c011'>For full a minute the torrent beat—whilst they sat
voiceless, cowering. Then it ceased as suddenly as it
had come; and the sun poured its beams with such
strength that they began to pant for the air. When the
doors were opened, they looked out upon a scene so
brilliant that they were obliged to shade their eyes.
Never had the sun been as potent thus early.</p>

<p class='c011'>They sank again upon the couches; and listened with
dread to the running off of the water from the galley’s
deck.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My poor galley,” the queen murmured after a little,
“in what a state is it. And the food—it is ruined.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thus is it that the gods smile upon me,” triumphed
Atlano.</p>

<p class='c011'>The four confounded ones glanced hopelessly at each
other. Even Electra was despairing. What evil fate
was this?</p>

<p class='c011'>Suddenly, footsteps were heard just without the door.
Electra arose; and looked out to perceive Sensel.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is it, Sensel?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Naught is harmed.” And he pointed toward the
hold. It was closed and the deck shorn of its baskets.
He pointed next to Azu, who like himself was dripping,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>but whose port was that of a conqueror. Then at Electra’s
inquiring look, he continued:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I was in the hold when the sky darkened. It took
scarce a minute to gather the baskets, throw them into
the hold and close it. I had ended while ye stood confounded
and then began to flee. As ye darted down the
stairway, I called Azu; and we leaped from this galley
to that of the queen, and threw over her withdrawing
room the shield used for showers, and drew in the outer
rugs and couches. The awnings and hanging are dripping;
but, with this sun, will dry in a few minutes. Thou
shouldst have seen Azu work!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sensel, thou hast saved us. Azu, the queen shall
know.” Then Electra turned to the eager listeners inside.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou seest,” she said to the king.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I hear, and it is Electra,” he returned mockingly.
Though it was plain that Sensel’s words had upset him,
as he was paling and flushing in a manner distressing to
witness; and his eyes were sullen and averted.</p>

<p class='c011'>The queen was silently giving thanks. Then she
arose, her expression most confident.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hellen, Æole, Electra, what is this strange heat but
the more aid from above. Let us not sink under it, but
go out, and look as it drieth everything.”</p>

<p class='c011'>They arose to follow her, therewith hearing the
familiar sound of a body falling. Azu was ready. He
again lay flat in expectation of the king.</p>

<p class='c011'>But when they had passed out, and had waited, and
the king came not, Queen Atlana said, “Azu, arise.”</p>

<p class='c011'>When he was on his feet, she continued, “Azu, I speak
the thanks of all. Well hast thou done. May I never
forget it!”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>Azu’s smile was ecstatic; and, between bows to the
ground, and gasps, he managed to reply:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Most gracious, most glorious Queen, for thee I can
never do enough. What hast thou done for me!”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a long speech for him, and rather overcoming.
Seeing this, the queen said in her kindest tone, “And
now, Azu, my robe.”</p>

<p class='c011'>When he had shuffled behind her, and was holding
her train in his loving manner, she beckoned to Sensel
who came to kneel gallantly before her. Then she extended
to him her hand which he kissed in prince-like
fashion—and to her surprise.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sensel, thou wilt not look for words. None could
speak what I feel.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Gracious Queen, the smile thou givest me, speaketh
beyond words. And, it was but little.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It hath saved Æole and Hellen.” Her low tone was
so impressive that the hearers were thrilled. Then, in
sprightly fashion she subjoined:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now, Sensel, arise. And lead us that we may note
the power of this sun.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Thereupon, they walked about to exclaim, “The
wonder of it!” “The wonder of it!” For, so rapid was
the drying that clouds of vapor were ascending. Already
was the deck as free from moisture as it had
been before.</p>

<p class='c011'>As to the king, long was he in appearing. When he
came out to them, his head was drooping, his tones mumbling.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Atlana, I yield. Hellen and Æole may go. And
thou mayest take thy ‘little sail;’ though let it not go
beyond a few hours. I look for thee by the wane of the
day.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>In the midst of the sudden joy, was felt perplexity,
fear. What had come upon him? Was this most alarming
interposition of the elements producing effect? Or,
was there more beneath?</p>

<p class='c011'>After some moments’ quiet, the queen of her incredulity,
asked, “Atlano, meanest thou—that I can go?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I mean it.” Again were the words mumbled: then,
with bent head, he turned to leave them.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Æole, in her pity and gratitude, went after him;
and said bravely:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Gracious King—”</p>

<p class='c011'>He faced her. “Speak, Æole.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Gracious King, bid us good speed. And, we would
thank thee.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Æole, thank me not. I would have done thee—harm.
But—the powers—have come—between!” He
spoke with a queer reluctance of articulation. Then an
expression came into his face that caused the beholders to
shrink with horror. It was that of a soul that, at last, sees
the vortex, the Gehenna, to which it has been trending;
of a soul that, in spite of its better knowledge and its fast
coming fate, would not shake off the evilness of its bent,
the sensuality that had destroyed it!</p>

<p class='c011'>Æole, alone, did not see this look. For, as the king
faced her, she had glanced at Sensel to receive his intent
gaze; and thereby had blushed, and bent her head. She
lifted it to behold him staring at the king, horrified.
When, in her alarm, she looked about her, it was but to
see horror depicted on every face. As all eyes were on
the king, she then turned to him.</p>

<p class='c011'>The questioning look of her deep, clear, innocent eyes
was as a shock to Atlano; and a good impulse stirred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>him. Possibly some unselfish spring was yet remaining
within him. His lips moved as if he would speak,
though no sound came at first, with all his effort; but
finally, his unwilling tongue moved spasmodically.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good speed, Æole. And know—that—for thee—I
would have dared earth and the powers beyond. But
now I tell thee—I am glad that ruin doth threaten me—to
thy saving!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bending over, he kissed her robe. Then with no look
about him, moved from their sight.</p>

<p class='c011'>Æole was so overcome that Sensel came beside her,
and led her within the withdrawing room, and to a couch.
As she sank thereon, he entreated, “Æole, cheer. The
worst is past. Now for Pelasgia!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But thou, Sensel?” she murmured.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will go with thee. I came to go when I willed.
It is my will to leave this island.”</p>

<p class='c011'>All precious was the joy that came into her face.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sensel, always have I felt that thou camest for our
good.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Æole, the service of my life is thine.” Then, noting
her changing color, her shrinking attitude, he added, in
his usual voice, “Now will I go to the queen. She hath
sore pain.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But the poor queen, weeping bitterly, was just about
to enter, supported by Electra and Rica. These drew
her to a couch. When she had calmed somewhat,
Sensel bowed low before her, awaiting permission to address
her. “What is it Sensel?” she was quick to ask.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Gracious Queen, shall I give the word to the captains
to call the oarsmen that we may go?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yea, yea!” she cried brokenly. “And forever!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>May I never more see this landing. May Atlano be forever
freed from my presence. Better were it for me to
sink beneath the sea than to cumber him further. Oh,
for death! So that he may no longer see my sad eyes,
and through them the grieving heart beneath. Electra, I
pray for death!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not so, dear Queen,” answered Electra, bending over
her in tears. “It is not thine to pray for death. It was
not mine to pray for death as I did when I thought Æole
had passed away. It is ours to be calm, and bear, believing
all is ordered.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Electra,” was whispered, “this moment I feel that I
hate Æole; and now that I say it I am flooded with
fond feeling for her. I am torn—torn!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ever art thou fond of her, dear Queen. But, thou
wouldst have reason, were she not so pure, to hate her
without end. But, thou must think, it is Æole—pure,
weak, grieving Æole.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know, I know. I will go to her; and clasp her.”
With this, she arose, and went to sit beside Æole, to draw
her to her as a mother might. Then they whispered together
to their comforting.</p>

<p class='c011'>Meanwhile, Sensel had informed the captains of the
galleys that they were to depart; thus, pennants of red
and gold were run up to call the oarsmen to their posts.
When these were in their places, Sensel came again to
the queen to report; and added:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Queen Atlana, I go now to my master. We will
meet the galleys off the great pile of rocks on the eastern
coast.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She smiled faintly, despite her sore heart. “Thanks
to thee, Sensel. And, good speed to thee.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>After one look at Æole, he bounded from the galley
to the stairway; and vanished.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then the queen, with Æole, Electra, and her ladies
went on board her own galley. Instantly the galleys
moved off; and were followed by many of those of the
nobles as well as those of less degree, in compliment to
herself. While these glided through the canal, and
through the water lilies of the stream, the islanders on
the banks chanted their love for her. And happily they
sang.</p>

<p class='c011'>Atlana, in response, stood under her awning, bowing
to right and left, and kissing her hand. Thus, on sped
the galleys to the harbor; through the harbor to the
ocean; and along the coast to the point where the ‘Silent
Priest’ was to join them.</p>

<p class='c011'>Here, opposite the pile of rocks, did himself and Sensel
push off in the fantastic boat; whilst grouped on the
sands, priests and people watched them, strangely quiet.</p>

<p class='c011'>But, when the ‘Silent Priest’ had crossed the smiling
water almost to the galleys, Queen Atlana showed herself.
At once, the mass of islanders on the shore became
vociferous in their acclamations. Many, of their zeal,
threw off mantles, dashed into the surf, and swam even
to her galley, arriving there almost with the silent
one. When the latter had ascended, and was bowing
low before her, the swimmers again burst forth in
acclamations to be echoed strenuously by those on the
galleys. The air was full of gladness.</p>

<p class='c011'>Grouped under the queen’s awning were herself, the
‘Silent Priest,’ Hellen, Æole, Electra, and the ladies Rica
and Elna—when the signal was given to move on. After
Sensel had fastened the fantastic boat to the queen’s galley,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>he came on board also. At once, the voyage was resumed,
and to the eastward, the swimmers and those remaining
on the shore chanting melodiously their
farewells.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XV.<br /> <span class='large'>THE ALTAR FIRES GO OUT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>On hastened Atlano to the courtyard of the palace.
And from there, drove to the temple in wild fashion.
For a great dread was besetting him.</p>

<p class='c011'>When the others had gone out to watch the quick
evaporation, he, whilst pondering in dismay upon Sensel’s
promptness, had suddenly realized that a strange torpor
was overcoming him. Horrified, he essayed to break
this, succeeding only after great struggling. Then, his
tongue seemed to swell to twice its size, and clove to
his mouth. In an agony of fear, he tried to burst its
bands, it, at length, also yielding. Thereupon, an abject
terror of his misdeeds and their penalty so possessed him
that he hastened out, to atone in slightest measure, if possible,
by accession to the voice’s demands.</p>

<p class='c011'>Further, spurred by his dread and some remnant of
good yet left in him, he confessed his evil desire, and deprecated
it. Now he was speeding to the temple to confer
with Oltis as to what these evils might forbode, what
might be done to ward off further visitations, aye, judgments!</p>

<p class='c011'>In the temple, he found only the presiding priest Kluto,
and the handmaids whose duty it was to attend the
sacred fire.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>“Kluto, where are the other priests?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Gracious King, they have gone to the sands that they
may wait upon the silent one.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where is Urgis—that this hath been done?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Gracious King, Urgis hath gone, likewise.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Urgis?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Gracious King, thus is it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And—hath the high priest gone?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Priest Hafoe hath told it that the high priest sitteth
again as stone in the inner holy place.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why is the altar fire thus feeble?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Gracious King, I know not. In spite of us, it will
but flicker, and, at times, doth threaten to go out.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Here was a dreadful omen.</p>

<p class='c011'>The king would have spoken further, but his voice
was thickening, his tongue growing sluggish: so, he
turned abruptly from Kluto; and, with uncertain step,
passed into the inner sanctuary. Here was still burning
the ‘Silent Priest’s’ hand lamp; here the altar fire flickered
feebly as that of the temple proper; here the great
apartment was in shadow save where the sun’s beams
entered faint through the hangings of the apertures.</p>

<p class='c011'>In a passion of fear, Atlano looked about him, and
called, “Oltis—Oltis!”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was no response. Though quickly his eyes
lighted upon the unhappy Oltis, who was sitting behind
the statue of Amen, his rigid body bent forward, his eyes
bright to madness.</p>

<p class='c011'>The almost frenzied Atlano dragged a chair opposite
him; and, as he sank into it, his sluggish tongue mumbled,
“Oltis—speak.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Oltis’ eyes showed his struggle to comply.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>“Is thy tongue dead?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Oltis gave a sigh so long and deep that the king shook
in terror.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oltis, strive to shake off thy torpor. I felt the like
coming but mastered it; though my tongue is not
yet right.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was another sigh.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oltis, the silent one hath gone. Ere this, he hath
joined the Pelasgian children. And they are sailing
away—even to the queen.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The queen!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The words burst from the marble Oltis, so terrifying
Atlano that he leaped from his chair.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah—thou speakest!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The queen hath left the palace?” vociferated Oltis.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yea, for half the day.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And—with the Pelasgian children—and—their father—Deucalion?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Atlano almost fell back in his chair. As it was, he
was obliged to lean upon it; and then stared at Oltis, his
eyeballs protruding, his lips ashy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I say—with Deucalion. Thy Deucalion—the ‘Silent
Priest’—hath mastered us.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oltis, thou ravest!”</p>

<p class='c011'>But Atlano felt it was not raving. Like a flash, it went
through him. He fell into his chair, confounded, baffled.
Great sparks danced before his eyes; his tongue refused
to move. If he could but speak the dreadful thoughts
surging in his brain; if he could but kill Oltis for telling
him this!</p>

<p class='c011'>Oltis spurred on, in spite of his helplessness and fear,
continued:</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>“The Silent One is Deucalion. I knew it when ye had
fled. He spoke to me. The horror of it!—He said he
would search into the hidden things of the ‘Deeps.’ He
opened the door. He went down the stairway. He saw
the handmaids. He threatened to bring in the islanders.
He forced me to go on the portico, and speak. Ah, he
is a master!” The marble figure sighed as if it would
rend itself.</p>

<p class='c011'>Atlano was writhing and groaning in his torment. But
joy—his voice was coming. He hissed, “Oltis, thou art
a craven. Oh, for strength to get at thee! To aid—Deucalion!
I will strangle thee for this. Then will I be
king, high priest, chief priest in one. For Urgis shall
die, likewise!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then he made the motion to spring, his hand out-clutched,
Oltis, with tongue again mute, awaiting him:
but in spite of his mad hatred, his baffled revenge, he had
not power to arise. In his immobility and dread, he
moaned:</p>

<p class='c011'>“My foe—Deucalion—here—under my hand—and I
not to feel it. How often have I longed to yield him on
the altar—that ‘Silent Priest.’ Baffled, and by such arts!
Oh, for Deucalion! To have him here for one instant,
even!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Call to mind how thou didst pale before him but last
night,” derided Oltis. “Wouldst thou grow weak again
under his eyes? The man is master of strange, dire powers.
Well is it he hath gone. Though—the queen!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Name her not. Ah, how hath she known thee. How
hath she borne with me. What sorrow hath been hers.
Mine eyes open to it. Fool that I am. Oltis, add another
to thy doings. Call me fool!”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>But Oltis again was dumb.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oltis, I curse thee! Some good was in me when I
came to the throne. Some good was in me as long as I
hearkened to the queen; but that good, thou hast
turned to evil. The evil in me thou didst pander to—so
that I am what I am. And why, Oltis, didst thou pander?
It was not for warmth for me. Nay, nay, I read
thee. I saw thou didst look to be king. I knew of thy
draught of death; that thou hadst just got it in shape so
that it would leave no sign. (Thy father, of his age,
needed not such art.)—Ah, but I like to see thee writhe!—And
well I bided, laughing at thee. Poor Atlana,
how often hath she warned me. Now—for thee!”</p>

<p class='c011'>He half arose, Oltis again awaiting him, his eyes
flaming; but, as before, he sank in his chair, his muscles
refusing to go farther.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why can I not walk?” he cried frantically. “Oltis,
thou art bewitching me? Or, is it, in truth; the gods?
We made the show not to believe in them—did we not?
We believe now, ha—ha! Let us not fear. Let us
curse each other—and them. Then will I go from here,
and hunt up those lagging priests. This light on the
altar groweth too dim. The gods will be getting in even
worse temper because of it. Come, Oltis, raise thy voice.
Let us curse together!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Again he essayed to rise. But, in that moment, all
power of volition forsook him. Instantly, his feet, hands,
head, body, seemed encased in iron, in iron weighing tons.
Not a muscle could he move for the immense pressure.
His tongue was the deadest weight of all. His will was
all of strength remaining him; and that struggled long,
superhumanly. But the end was that he like Oltis could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>only sit as stone, and stare before him—and into the terrible
eyes opposite.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet, how active was the mind becoming. How
keenly, already, was it suffering in its recollections of
evil, its regrets, its humiliation at being baffled—its horror
of the oncoming fate. Oh, for madness, instead!</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus sat the two in the growing gloom. Thus sat
they when the priests returned from the seashore where
they had been carried by the silent one’s will. When
they entered, the hand lamp was burned out, the altar
fire so feeble that they hastened, alarmed, to restore it.
The more than semi-darkness was terrifying.</p>

<p class='c011'>Search was made for another hand lamp. When one
was found and lighted, Atlano and Oltis were discovered
sitting behind the statue of Amen. Both were marble,
save their baleful eyes. At sight of them, the startled
priests fell back one upon another; then turned, shrieking,
to flee.</p>

<p class='c011'>When without in the temple, Kluto said to them, “We
have brought vengeance upon us. Let us try to win
pardon while we may. But look—I cannot make this
flame last long.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We will help.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Terror-stricken, they fanned the dying blaze. Though
no life would come in it. At length, they tottered to the
portico, suffocating of dread.</p>

<p class='c011'>But—what had come over the face of earth? It was
smiling when they had entered the temple after returning
from the shore; yet now, a strange gloom, a murkiness
was enveloping sky, ocean, stream, valley, hill. And
significant, far-off rumblings were beginning; the ocean
was becoming white; the stream Luith, as well as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>other streams, was leaping up its banks. On every side,
people were crying out in affright. What was this?</p>

<p class='c011'>Priests and handmaids ran out to the great court; and
paused to look about in horror. Suddenly, lurid lights
filled the northern heavens. Were the mountains of the
northeast belching flame? Was that deafening noise to
the east the roaring of the incensed waters? They fell
on their knees to supplicate forlornly.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Kluto, best of his fellows, could not pray long for
thought of the king and high priest. He started to his
feet, crying:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who will go with me to save King Atlano and High
Priest Oltis?”</p>

<p class='c011'>None answered. Indignant, he turned from his brethren
to dart back to the temple; and flew through it to
the inner sanctuary.</p>

<p class='c011'>The hand lamp shed a feeble light. Upon the altar
were a few faint sparks. Kluto made his way toward
king and high priest who still sat rigid, glaring. He
spoke, implored them to rise again and again—but only
their despairing eyes answered.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then he pulled the one, the other. As well might he
have tried to move the temple itself. Almost frenzied,
he cried:</p>

<p class='c011'>“King Atlano, High Priest Oltis, come, come. The
ocean seetheth, the streams leap their banks, the mountains
throw forth fire, the earth grumbleth. Come, come!
Break your bonds!”</p>

<p class='c011'>But they stirred not, though their eyes grew like flames
in their endeavors. Kluto then tried to lift Oltis’ hand.
As well might he have tried to move the statue of Amen
that frowned in front of them. Before this statue, he
flung himself.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>“O Amen, have mercy. Break their bonds!”</p>

<p class='c011'>So alive was his faith, that he felt some answer must
come to his passionate appeal; but the silence remained
unbroken.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Amen, I cannot go. I cannot leave them to this. I
will share their fate!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Now was the silence broken. There were heard the
pattering of light feet and the cries of women. These,
speeding through the western passage were the greater
part of the handmaids who had been resting in their
rooms after the vigils of the night; and who had just
aroused to the terrors without. At their despairing tones,
Kluto forgot king and priest, and ran out to them.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Get ye to the great court, there to pray. For the
end is upon us!”</p>

<p class='c011'>They crowded about him, terrified and irresolute.
When he had led them without among the priests and
other handmaids, he went before the people thronging
into the court, and bade them pray for the safety of the
island.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the majority, in scorn, received his words. Not
even the most anxious could bring themselves to believe
this paradisiacal island in danger. Possibly Atlano and
Oltis might suffer, but their dear island could not come
to harm! Had not the gods loved it? Had not one
dwelt in it? And was he not their father? Had not
blessings ever been showered upon it? No—no—their
island must be safe!</p>

<p class='c011'>But, as they ran in and out of the court, up and down
the hill, along the banks of canal and stream, complaints
of king and high priest began to rise.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Said we not evil would follow that loss, ruin in Pelasgia?”
murmured one.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>“True, one evil bringeth another,” returned a second.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It may be that the gods were angry then, with King
Atlano,” whispered an old and thoughtful-looking man
to his wife.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But, Queen Atlana is good,” spoke their daughter, a
young mother who was standing beside them with a little
child clinging to each hand, and who was eyeing in
dread the encroaching water of the stream. “Would she
were here. Why, why did she sail away?—But look,
Father, Mother! The water riseth even to the top of the
bank! Oh, my dear ones!” And she kneeled to draw
forlornly within her arms her little ones. “Oh, wert thy
father but here!”</p>

<p class='c011'>For their father was afar. He was the captain of the
queen’s galley.</p>

<p class='c011'>Past this kneeling, weeping mother were surging the
distracted islanders, some making their way to the shore
others rushing to gaze upon the menacing streams,
others flying to the court of the temple there to plead
for mercy, others running to the summit of the hill in
order to view better the fast brightening sky of the northeast.
And continuously now was the earth shaking,
groaning beneath them—whilst great raindrops were
beginning to fall, and Amen’s thunderbolts to play.</p>

<p class='c011'>About this mother moaning over her children gathered
other mothers with their husbands and little ones, the
plaints mingling in chorus. But soon came a shaking so
long and severe that every voice hushed, every face set
in terror. Then all groveled on the ground.</p>

<p class='c011'>When the trembling had subsided, and they were
standing erect again, an old woman said to be the most
aged person on the island, spoke in shrillest tone:</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>“This is what cometh of handmaids and animal gifts
upon the altar. Think ye your fathers would have been
thus led to evil. Oh, ye fools of Atlantis!”</p>

<p class='c011'>She eyed the islanders about her with such derision
that they forgot their terror, and felt like rushing upon
her in a body.</p>

<p class='c011'>A gray-haired, quivering man retorted:</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is well for thee, old Nogoa, to stand there and
taunt us islanders when it is known thou hast ever been
loudest in favor of these new doings. Oh, thou old
feather that goeth with the wind! Have a care—or thou
wilt be more dragged in the dirt than thou hast been!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hah, it is the craven Puppo who speaketh,” returned
Nogoa viciously. “He who saw his daughter forced
into the inner holy place, and lifted not his voice to man
or heaven against it. It seemeth he can cry out only
when an old woman talketh.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Puppo darted for her. As she fell over backward in
her effort to get out of his reach, a tall young man rushed
between them.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Puppo, she speaketh truth. Thou wert a craven; and
hast been a toad to king and priests ever since. Look
at me,” he continued to the people. “Dear to me was
his daughter Lota, and I would have made her my wife.
And in an hour—ah instant—the world became black to
me. But became it black to him? Hath he not laughed
with the loudest, bent the lowest, slept through it?
Thou worse than hypocrite! Get thee away!”</p>

<p class='c011'>He looked so evilly upon Puppo, and was so seconded
by those listening, that Puppo, after a wicked glance at
old Nogoa who had been lifted up and placed on a fallen
bough, slunk off.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>The young man continued: “Nogoa, though as false,
as full of guile as Puppo, is right in this: we have looked on
when Atlano and Oltis changed the worship in these vile
ways with never a nay. For this, woe is upon us! I
come from my cave on yon mount where the fires rage
to bid you flee in your galleys while there is time.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why dost thou not flee, Monon? Show us the way,”
screeched Puppo, who was now brave because he was
quite well to one side.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I flee not because I wish death. Every moment have
I longed for it—as thou shouldst have done—since thy
daughter vanished!”</p>

<p class='c011'>A shout of derision went up for the benefit of the hidden
Puppo, whose habitual discretion forbade further
speech for the while.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Monon,” shouted a young man at his right, “I, for
one, will stand by the island to the last!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Vociferous became the outcries in accordance. When
these were subsiding, a scream was heard from the wife
of the galley captain: and then the words, “Look, look!
Luith floweth up over the bank; and higher—higher!”</p>

<p class='c011'>They followed her glance to perceive that the stream
was rising even above its banks, whilst the affrighted
islanders thereon were beginning to flee, shrieking. The
beholders, in their terror, swayed as one; and then groveled
to implore mercy.</p>

<p class='c011'>But in wilder terror, at once arose to shake off the gray
dust that was beginning to fall everywhere. And one
voice shrieked, “The ashes from the mouth of the
mountain! To the sands—to the sands!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The mass stood irresolute, dazed. Then went up the
cry, “Yea, the sands—the sands!”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>They parted to hasten toward that goal, youths supporting
the aged, parents bearing their tender young.
But they had not gone far, when, from the east, came one
running as if pursued by demons; and he was crying:</p>

<p class='c011'>“We are lost! We are lost! The sea riseth even to
cover the great pile of rocks! It will be upon us!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Therewith he fell senseless among them.</p>

<p class='c011'>After him came others running like madmen, and repeating
his words. One of these asked, “Where is the
king?” Another, “Where is the high priest?”</p>

<p class='c011'>An islander who had been in the court when the priests
and handmaids hastened from the temple, answered:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Atlano and Oltis sit in the inner holy place behind
the statue of Amen, frozen in body, burning in torment
of mind. There they will stay until the end, for no one
hath power to move them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>A cry of horror went up.</p>

<p class='c011'>“How knowest thou this?” asked another of the newcomers,
as he wiped the ashes from his lips.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I heard the chief priest and Priest Hafoe tell of it
after they had fled the temple.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who fled from the temple?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The priests, handmaids, and serving men. None are
left save those two frozen ones. Good company are they
for each other!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Unanimous were the angry outcries of agreement.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well is it that the queen hath gone,” remarked another
newcomer. “We saw her off. May she have
sailed too far to get back to this. The sea doeth its best
to keep her away.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The dear queen!” cried one after another.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Poor queen—she hath sorrowed and been meek.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>“And we have known it, and lifted not our voices,”
rang Monon’s tones.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yea; and many of us wives have been treated as herself,”
said a clear voice from among a group of women.</p>

<p class='c011'>The male hearers accepted this in different ways.
Some smiled scornfully; others glanced furtively at their
fellows; a few appeared conscience stricken. A brave
one exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will own I have sinned. I wedded my niece, which
was against the old law. But—there is Puppo—he wedded
his aunt!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And tormented his first wife, the mother of Lota, to
her death that he might do it,” screamed old Nogoa.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who put away five husbands?” yelled the unseen
Puppo. There was silence. Then he answered sepulchrally,
“Old Nogoa!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Old Nogoa was speechless.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Monon spoke up, “Nogoa is not the only one.
How many are there who have done as she! Until these
last years, how holy hath been wedlock; yet now, on
every side, is its mockery. The handmaids and the animal
gifts on the altar are but a few of the wicked changes in
the laws of our olden fathers. Further, the curse of avarice
is upon this island. And we have been steeped in
pleasure, in sense. The body of flesh hath been our one
thought. The inner body—the spirit—hath been forgotten,
hath become of evil shape—is evil. Let us look to
it! Should this storm pass by, let us begin a better
growth of the spirit. Let us go back to the warmth and
trust of our fathers. Then may we have the knowledge
of heaven that was theirs.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thinkest thou there is still hope, Monon?” interrupted
a by-stander.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>“Of what?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That we may come out of this?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I believe there is no hope. But, we can die without
murmur.”</p>

<p class='c011'>In the next instant, he pointed to the temple gateway.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Behold—Priest Kluto and the handmaids.”</p>

<p class='c011'>They looked to perceive Kluto marshaling the handmaids
without. Well had he pleaded for this with Chief
Urgis, pleaded that the wretched young creatures might
be restored to the arms of their kindred whom he knew
must be awaiting them. And he prevailed, as Urgis
and the other priests had become so given over to terror
as not to care for consequences.</p>

<p class='c011'>Further, Kluto was in the main, correct; for, as the
handmaids stood clinging to each other, and glancing
piteously about them through the falling ashes and rain,
they were surrounded by watching, anxious dear ones;
and began to be suffocated almost of embraces. All
save three!</p>

<p class='c011'>Yes, three there were that stood shrinking, as they
lost hope of recognition. In dreary silence, they waited
a little, and then moved beside Priest Kluto, who had
been looking inquiringly from them to the islanders.
But all, excepting those caressing the fortunate handmaids,
were acting dazed because of the thickening showers
of ashes and the now pelting rain. And prayers and
groans were filling the air.</p>

<p class='c011'>So Priest Kluto gathered closer the three handmaids;
and whispered to them. Thereupon, the four began to
make their way through the excited, ejaculating crowds
in order to ascend to the summit, to the temple of Poseidon
and Cleito.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>“Priest Kluto, thou goest the wrong way,” called out
a youth as he pointed to several galleys, that, unfastened
from their moorings, were being borne higher and higher
by the rising stream. “Why not set off in those galleys,
and save the handmaids?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No galley could live on the white water beyond.
We go to the summit, to beseech the mercy of Amen
and Poseidon; and, should the last moment draw nigh,
to meet it as becometh us.” With encouragement, he
looked upon the shrinking handmaids.</p>

<p class='c011'>But one cried hysterically, “If my mother and father
were not in Chimo. There is cheer in dying together!”</p>

<p class='c011'>In sweet, plaintive tones, spoke the second, “There
is cheer in not being forgotten. I have father, mother,
sisters, brothers. Yet not one cometh to look for me!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“For very good cause,” screamed old Nogoa, who was
still sitting on the fallen bough, and whom they were passing.
“Celesa, I saw thy father, mother, sisters, and
brothers go off in their galley after the queen.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I thank the gods!” And Celesa, with face illumined,
fell on her knees to implore that they might be beyond
danger; to give further thanks that she was not forgotten,
that she alone of her family was selected to suffer.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Kluto raised her, and drew her arm within his.
Then the third handmaid spoke low, “Happy are ye two!
Though I have neither father, mother, sister, nor brother,
yet one there was who cared for me when I was dragged
to the temple. But him I see not. He hath not watched
to know if I should need him. Yet—we played together—as
children!” She laid her head upon Celesa’s breast,
and sobbed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“His name?” whispered Celesa.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>“Veris.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where is the youth Veris?” inquired Celesa in low,
clear tones, but without looking about her.</p>

<p class='c011'>A voice quite near replied, “It is even now time for
him to come back from Chimo, whither he went a few
days since.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Luta was overjoyed. What were these dangers if she
was not forgotten? What was death if Veris shared it?
Her face lighted rosily as she looked around her, half
expecting to see him speeding through the blinding
showers of ashes and rain. Then she seized Celesa’s
arm, and said in exultation, “Now Priest Kluto, can I
follow thee even unto death!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus, when Priest Kluto had given his other arm to
the first handmaid, did the four stand abreast, and look
up to the summit, and at the volcano’s light beyond undauntedly.
They began to move upward, upon their
faces coming the expression of the loving, trusting martyr.
In amaze, the people beheld them; and could not but
show some reflection. One cried: “They will die well.
Why cannot we?” Then he, being a singer, commenced
a hymn to Amen. So magnetic were his tones that the
people about him joined in; a moment more, and the
multitude was swelling the refrain. To this music, the
four ascended to the summit, there to kneel before the
temple of Poseidon and Cleito.</p>

<p class='c011'>But along by the palace was coming a horseman from
the west, his horse smoking and foaming, for he had
fairly flown over the country between Chimo and this
place. As horse and rider came in among the chanting
multitude, the singing ceased, and many voices cried,
“Veris! Veris!”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>Veris, as he walked his horse in among them, shouted,
“The island sinketh! Everywhere as I came across, rise
the streams! Already hath the sea laid Chimo half
under water!”</p>

<p class='c011'>He had been nearing the temple gateway. In a few
moments more, he was looking through with most anxious
face. Then he said, “I will go in.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Veris, look not there for Luta,” called an islander
who had been running after him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Whither shall I look?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Herself and two other handmaids have gone with
Priest Kluto to the temple above to pray.” And the man
pointed in the direction.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will join them.” Then, in happy tones, Veris
thanked his friend, shook his hand, and turned to mount
the hill; and as he mounted, the rain began to fall in
sheets, the thunderbolts to strike.</p>

<p class='c011'>Terror-stricken, the people scattered, seeking shelter.
Some ran to their homes, others to the palace. But
many rushed into the great court of the temple, thence
on to the temple, there to utter dismayed cries at beholding
the altar fire but a faint spark. Despite the almost
darkness they pressed on, invading the sacredness of
the inner sanctuary. Here, by the dim lamplight, did
they further behold Atlano and Oltis, still as iron, still
glaring at each other. And but a faint spark was remaining
on this altar, likewise!</p>

<p class='c011'>Shriek after shriek went up as these intruders looked
upon king and priest; these shrieks being echoed by the
dazed ones running through passages, apartments, and
temple until it seemed as though the weight of sound
must bring the walls about them.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>Some of these intruders even ventured to pass on
through the private passage of Atlano and Oltis. Perceiving
the end door open, they went toward it, and its
dark stairway allured them. Down they rushed to the
open door below through which a faint light could be
seen. And hustled, awed, into the crypt-like apartment
whose lamps were still burning, there to look about them
in wonder, terror; and then dashed for the white objects at
the far end!</p>

<p class='c011'>There was an agonized staring, screams, yells, a frenzied
retreat up the stairway, frantic disclosures when they
reached the inner sanctuary. “The lost handmaids!”
“Dead—dead!” “In the vault below!” “See for yourselves!”
were the cries to the ones that were here.</p>

<p class='c011'>Many of these ran down to look for themselves, whilst
the discoverers hastened out to inform others. The
second party, in turn, came tearing up, maddened; and
rushed without to corroborate the reports of the first.
The listening islanders, aroused to their gross neglect,
their insensate yielding, were excited to extreme hatred and
desire for revenge. With Monon as leader, they hastened
in mass to the inner sanctuary, showering curses the while
upon Atlano and Oltis. And, when before them, further
cursed; then spat upon them. Yet still the two sat rigid.</p>

<p class='c011'>As they were thus reviled—as the revilers endeavored
to tear them from their seats—the great structure began
to rock, and so terrifically that the infuriated ones, forgetful
even of their revenge, turned to flee. Better the
rain, the lurid sky, the unearthly gloom, the showering
ashes, the thunderbolts than this!</p>

<p class='c011'>The last to leave cried in their flight, “The spark is
out! The spark is out!” but to repeat the same when
the temple’s altar was shot by!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>But Luta was in Veris’ arms; and Kluto was holding
fast Celesa—whilst, on the summit, the four received the
full fury of the elements. But they were happy. As to
the first handmaid, she had passed away while praying.
And was lonely no longer!</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>As the galleys sailed to the east, the Atlantean eyes
lingered with pride upon the island. Never had it looked
fairer. What other spot of earth was so fitting to be
chosen the abode of a god? What other land had so
thriven, so conquered, so repeated itself even in the farthest
climes? Surely upon this island the sun must shine
forever!</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus, in happy accord, did they begin to sing praises
to their father Poseidon, the while throwing back fond
kisses at their island, and even at the water which was
alive with porpoises and dolphins, the former leaping
their highest in their sportive appreciation of the music,
the latter enjoying it with a dignified serenity befitting
the state which the Atlanteans ever accorded them.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet continually were the singers of every galley glancing
at the group under the queen’s awning. In the midst,
stood the ‘Silent Priest’ before the queen; and about
them were Æole, Electra, and Hellen; while near swayed
Sensel, a being as mysterious as the silent one. Small
wonder is it that the inquisitive islanders would have
gladly ceased their singing could they have heard what
was spoken by those so interested.</p>

<p class='c011'>When presented to the queen, the ‘Silent Priest’ had
bowed, then taken the hand she extended, and regarded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>her fixedly. At his magnetic touch, his eloquent look,
she thrilled; and her voice trembled, as she said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Father—whom we call the ‘Silent,’ rather should I
bow to thee. For thou art one whom the gods favor.
Of a truth, art thou sent of them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>As the silent one stood calm, intent, Æole thought,
“How is this grand being to answer the queen?” And
she drew nearer to him, her eyes filled with love rather
than awe. Noting this, Hellen, Electra, and Sensel
watched her eagerly.</p>

<p class='c011'>The next moment, she received a shock. The silent
one, though gesticulating as usual, was also speaking,
though in lowest tone.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Queen Atlana, now will I loose my tongue. In
truth, can I say the gods have favored me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>As his deep, musical tones continued, Æole had seized
his robe, then his arm; and next was looking up wistfully
in his face. Therewith, Electra began to weep; and
Hellen and Sensel turned away, for they could bear no
longer this look so commingled of remembrance, longing,
hope, doubt.</p>

<p class='c011'>The queen of her wonder and perturbation, exclaimed,
“We believed thee dumb!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Queen Atlana, I spoke not that I might baffle.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Baffle what?”—Very faint was the queen’s voice.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The foes of Æole and Hellen, gracious Queen.” He
put his arm about the half-fainting Æole, and drew her
to him. And Sensel glided beside them to whisper, “Be
strong, be strong, dear Æole.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She, though but half conscious, comprehended: and
never had she been so happy. In her ears was the music
of this sympathetic voice; upon her had come a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>tranquillity hardly of earth. In these arms so strongly
enfolding her was she to be borne to heaven? Were the
years on the island a dream? Surely these were the
arms in which she had been wont to rest when the rambles
over the dear Pelasgian fields had been too long,
this was the touch that had ever soothed her!</p>

<p class='c011'>Meanwhile, the queen was noting the astonishment of
the sailors, who had ceased singing, and were resting on
their oars. Thus, she whispered to Sensel:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Look that no one is within the withdrawing room.
Hither will we go.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Sensel glided off. The queen said, as though to herself,
“The ‘Silent Priest’ can only answer there.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Great was her agitation. The priest, because of the
quiet about them, bowed in acquiescence; further, signing
that there he would make all plain.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sensel returned to say the apartment was ready.
Waving for her ladies to remain, the queen walked off
supported by Electra; and was followed by the priest
bearing Æole, and Hellen and Sensel.</p>

<p class='c011'>Deep was the hush as they passed along. Not only
those of their own galley were interested. The occupants
of the galleys attending them had also quieted.
Every eye was fastened in wonder. When the six had
entered the withdrawing room, the hush continued as
the galleys pursued their way.</p>

<p class='c011'>The priest placed Æole upon a couch. But, as she
regained strength, she arose to her feet to gaze at him as
if charmed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Meanwhile the queen had sat down; and now was
motioning for the others to sit also. But the priest
shook his head, thereby causing her to question by her
look.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>“Queen Atlana, I will stand until all things are made
plain to thee.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The others chose to stand also. Electra brought a
fan, and fanned the queen, who had closed her eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>Shortly Atlana was able to ask, “Thou whom we call
the ‘Silent Priest’—who—art—thou?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Queen Atlana—I am—of Pelasgia.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He spoke in Atlantean; and repeated in Pelasgian.</p>

<p class='c011'>As the once familiar tongue was heard, Æole ran
half way toward him, clasped her hands, and looked up
in his face with eyes brilliant from unspeakable hope.
The most beautiful color came into her cheeks, and her
lips parted in a heavenly smile. So lovely, so angelic
was her expression that the beholders gazed spellbound.
And low, fervent were her tones.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I felt it, I felt it!—‘Silent Priest’ who art thou? Thy
name?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Daughter,” and he approached her, his arms extended,
“my name—is—Deucalion.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Father!” She would have fallen at his feet, had he
not caught her.</p>

<p class='c011'>The strong man was sobbing. “Ah, Æole, Æole, to
hold thee once again!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Father, father, after these years! But I knew thou
wouldst come, if of earth!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The rapture of her tone was so intense that he began
to fear for her. Thus, he bore her to a couch, and sat
beside her, supporting her; and then Electra came to chafe
her hands, and bathe her brow. Her trembling was excessive;
and she kept repeating, “Father—father. Thanks—thanks!”
Though soon she calmed to question, “Father,
tell me of mother. Is she well?” And extreme was
the pathos of her tone.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>“Æole, thy mother waiteth for thee.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What, then, is the past? One look from her will
heal all. Mother—mother!” So intense were tone and
look that Sensel turned away. And Electra sobbed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Throughout this scene, Queen Atlana had gazed stonily.
Though, at Æole’s cry for her mother, she thrilled,
and her eyes moistened. But she conquered her feeling,
and now asked in irony: “Sir Deucalion, doth this—thy
guile—come of the gods?”</p>

<p class='c011'>He arose, and bowed. “Most gracious Queen, this
is not guile.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How callest thou it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I call it working to the best end a matter between
Pelasgia and Atlantis.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is the look from thine eyes. I can see it in but
one light.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Queen Atlana, I have a right to mine own.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But not a right to lead us wrong—to—to use us.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Queen Atlana, how have we been used?”</p>

<p class='c011'>She answered not.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Queen Atlana, to gain my children, I have used powers
given from above. If through such, I have mastered
king and priests, have caused the sleep of Æole, have
drawn thee, judge whether or not the gods are with me.
Answer me in this, seemeth they to be with Atlantis?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The queen arose; and ignoring his question, demanded,
“Sir Deucalion of Pelasgia, if it doth agree with thy
will, let it be ordered that the galleys turn toward Atlantis.”
Bitter, scornful was her tone.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dear Queen Atlana, not yet,” interposed Electra.
“If thou wilt think for a moment, thou wilt judge he hath
done what thou wouldst have done in his place. Wouldst
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>thou not have done as much for children of thine own—even
for Æole and myself? Further, with all his art, his
power, none hath borne pain, hath lost life. Think, he
might have brought an army upon Atlantis.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Electra, I could stand the bringing of an army better
than this. How have I been tricked! To think I have
set myself against the king, even to coming on this ‘little
sail.’ And to please whom, to wait upon whom?
Why, his foe Deucalion. Atlano—Atlano!” Utter despair
was in tone and gesture.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Queen Atlana, thy coming is not of thine ordering.
Cast such thought from thee. If it hath been of mine
ordering, the higher will is behind,” urged Deucalion.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sir Deucalion, thy words are idle. As if the Higher
Good should set aside thought for all save thee and thine.
Thou hast high thought of self. But the sun shineth on
all. It is my will that my galley be turned.” Hard had
it been to control herself. And now her tones broke.
“Should harm come to Atlano, I cease to live! The
blame, the grief, I could not bear! Sir Deucalion, why
hast thou not moved? My galleys are not ordered!”
And she turned to Sensel, as if he might help her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“One moment, Queen Atlana, and I will. But first,
think not thy presence with Atlano could turn aside that
which doth threaten.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What meanest thou?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thy presence, can it turn aside the judgment of the
gods?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Faint, wondering was her tone, “So runneth the prophecy—so
runneth the prophecy.” She clasped her
hands to her forehead, gasping, “I shall go mad with
this dread upon me!”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>Æole ran to her, and put her arm around her. “Dear
Queen Atlana, call to mind it was thy kind thought for
us that made thee leave the king for this short season.
Could the gods make use of such?”</p>

<p class='c011'>At her touch and voice, the queen shivered, and averted
her face. “Æole, Æole, what thou hast cost me!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dear Queen, thou hast not ceased to care for me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Atlana held out her hand; and as Æole took it, replied:
“Nay, I have not ceased to care for thee. For thy sake,
I could joy over this. But, the king! Atlano—Atlano!”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a painful hush for a little, until she stooped
to kiss the suffering girl. Afterward, with her old dignity,
she commanded: “Sensel, as Sir Deucalion heedeth
not, I ask that thou wilt order the galleys to be turned.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dear Queen Atlana,” explained Deucalion, “how
could I give the order whilst thou art angered with me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>His tone and manner touched her. “Sir Deucalion,
speak not of anger. Let us have no further words as to
the right or wrong. We will part in peace.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He stooped and kissed her robe. “Queen Atlana,
thou art a queen, in truth. I go to make good thine
order.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Father,” burst from Hellen, “wilt thou note this fast
gathering darkness?”</p>

<p class='c011'>In his absorption, Deucalion had not remarked the
very sudden change. With serious, awed countenance,
he looked about him; and then spoke lightly, hoping to
reassure the blanching queen.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It meaneth rain. It seemeth as if the clouds gather.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But the suddenness of this gloom was as nothing to
the way in which it was deepening. It threatened to
hide them from each other. In her alarm, the queen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>moved toward the door; and this was opened for her
by Sensel just as her ladies were about to knock.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Gracious Queen,” said Rica, the first lady, “it will
storm. All is dark.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Atlana stepped out; and those behind her, followed.
They looked to become appalled.</p>

<p class='c011'>The atmosphere was thick and dark. The heavens
were obscure. An inky cloud lay over the island. The
sea was in foam. And the galleys were trying to keep
close, whilst on their decks were huddled the fear-stricken
islanders. These, upon perceiving the queen, cheered
faintly. Then a spokesman inquired: “Most gracious
Queen, shall we now go back?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The order hath been given,” shouted Hellen, at behest
of the almost rigid queen.</p>

<p class='c011'>Instantly, Sensel went to the captain of the queen’s
galley, who, thereupon, gave orders to the other galleys.
Thus, all the galleys were speedily pointed for Atlantis,
excepting the one appropriated to Hellen and Æole.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then did Hellen’s and Æole’s thought turn to the
downcast Electra. Indeed, poor Electra seemed overwhelmed.
Hellen, feeling he could not part with her,
grew fierce in his determination to the declaring, “Father,
if Electra goeth back, I go with her!”</p>

<p class='c011'>This was an unexpected obstacle, as Hellen looked a
rock. For the moment, Deucalion felt he was not equal
to it; and then spoke hesitatingly. “Queen Atlana, can
we have Electra?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The queen recovering somewhat, was resolute. “Sir
Deucalion, Electra will go with me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“To go again into the temple?” demanded Hellen.
“To be forced within the inner holy place? To—”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>“To lose her life?” interrupted Deucalion. “To pour
out her blood as water to aid the vain, fiendish quest of
king and priest? To stand over the crucible, and stir
this lifeblood until she perisheth of the drain? Thrice
cursed draught! The ‘Deeps’ tell the tale!”</p>

<p class='c011'>They stared aghast at Deucalion. But the queen interpreted.
Every unguarded sentence, every sudden pause
of Atlano reverted to her until she felt like accusing her
memory for its tenacity. And her horror grew. Tornado-like
it swept over her—the sufferings she had borne
through him, his contempt, his neglect, his indignities,
his infidelities. Now this revelation of Deucalion filled
the measure.</p>

<p class='c011'>Her spirit revolted. The words came clear and firm.
“Electra will not go back. I go to the king without her.
He can but yield me on the altar. Or try the blood of a
queen, for change, in seeking his draught.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Electra ran to embrace her. “Speak not of the altar,
dear Queen. After that, I cannot leave thee.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Atlana kissed her. “Dear Electra, I meant but to
jest when I spoke of the altar. We know the need of
my presence to the king.” Sad, bitter was her tone.
Then, bethinking her of their present condition, remorse
swept over her so that she tottered, and would have
fallen but for Sensel.</p>

<p class='c011'>At this moment, the blackness of the atmosphere became
appalling; and a cry of horror went up from the
galleys. All were pointing to the island. The queen
looked, and fell half fainting upon Deucalion. As he
sustained her, he whispered to Sensel: “It hath come!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Yes, it had come. There lay their beloved island at
the mercy of fierce warring elements. For, about it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>were dread waterspouts; upon it were falling sheets of
water; above it were playing the fiery messengers of
Amen. And the ocean responded white.</p>

<p class='c011'>Although so terror-stricken, the occupants of the galleys
were anxious to return; and but waited to follow
the queen. Already she was reviving; and presently
stood up for another view, saying reproachfully, “We
move not toward it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Look! Look!” cried many voices.</p>

<p class='c011'>And utter despair came upon all. The island was
rocking as if in the throes of a mighty earthquake, the
waves were leaping up its cliffs, the waterspouts were
breaking, the thunderbolts falling, the northern sky beginning
to blaze.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The mountain burneth!” they cried. And fell on
their knees. Once, only, in the history of the island, had
this volcano burst its bands.</p>

<p class='c011'>Queen Atlana had looked to fall back insensible into
the arms of Deucalion. He bore her to a couch in the
withdrawing room; and then hung over her with restoratives,
Electra, Æole, and the ladies—each dumb with apprehension.</p>

<p class='c011'>Outside, Hellen was addressing the galleys with tones
firm and far-reaching, for he felt all-powerful now that
Electra was not to return.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ye Nobles, Elders, and Captains; the ‘Silent Priest’
is firm that the island is doomed. If ye go back, it is to
your death. If ye press on with us toward the Middle
Sea, ye will be saved. What say ye, captains of the
galleys?”</p>

<p class='c011'>There followed hurried consultations between the captains
and their employers. Finally, one captain answered,
“We, of this galley, will press on.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>Another captain, he of the queen’s galley, spoke loud:
“My wife, my children are on the island. I would go to
them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou art the captain of the galley of the queen,”
cried another captain. “Wouldst thou leave the queen?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The poor captain looked irresolute for an instant.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The queen is dear; but my family is dearer. I take
it—my duty is to them, even more than to the queen.
There are other captains!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yea, there are other captains,” rang Hellen’s voice.
“The captain of my galley can take thy place, and I will
take his. Thus mayst thou go back, if any do, to the
island.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The captain of the galley containing the relatives of
the handmaid Celesa now called: “We will go back.
Come with us, captain of the galley of the queen.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The captain of the queen’s galley looked upon the
foaming sea, the beset island, his sailors at their oars—the
door of the withdrawing room through which the
fainting queen had been borne.</p>

<p class='c011'>“How can I leave the queen? My men? I will not.
I will stay. Heaven help me to bear this. Heaven help
my wife, my little ones!” One heartrending sob burst
from him. Then he stood firm, resigned.</p>

<p class='c011'>Loud cheers rent the air, though little cared he for these.
He stood, as in a dream, seeing only his wife, his little
ones, in their sore extremity.</p>

<p class='c011'>Immediately, the captain who had said he would return,
parted from them; and after him, went a few galleys
heroically. But the greater number, those bearing entire
families, determined to press on.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Hellen called: “Captains, your queen—our dear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>Queen Atlana—lieth as one dead. The captain of her
galley will lead us. In my galley is food enough for a
few days, if shared with care. Moreover, there are islands
near. And the Afrite Coast is not far.”</p>

<p class='c011'>A faint cheering replied.</p>

<p class='c011'>Hellen then spoke apart with his father. “Would we
could get the queen, her ladies, Æole and Electra on
my galley, for it is stronger, and holdeth the food. It
might be tempted to leave us.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is well thought of. But how to get them on
board? The rowers cannot keep near enough, so fierce
groweth the sea. I like not the crest of these waves.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It would be well to throw the ropes, to keep the galleys
close. The sea may quiet a little; and then can they
pass over.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sensel, what thinkest thou?” inquired Deucalion.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It can be done, should the sea calm a little. It would
be well to throw the ropes, when the rowers have come
as nigh as they can.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is well.”</p>

<p class='c011'>At the word, Hellen’s galley drew as near as it could
for the tossing sea. Then, the ropes were thrown bringing
them within unsteady touch, almost. Whilst thus
engaged, Hellen remarked: “Father, the air seemeth
more than full of rain. And yet none droppeth.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I, too, have wondered over it. But, where is Sensel?”</p>

<p class='c011'>For Sensel had most suddenly disappeared.</p>

<p class='c011'>But even as they began to look about for him he reappeared,
coming from the direction of the withdrawing
room. And in each hand was held a lamp of beautiful
pattern. These he hastened to lay before Deucalion.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou hast it, Sensel,” exclaimed the latter, his eyes
brightening.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>“Yea I thought this oil might ease the troubled waters.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou thinkest of everything.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou hast taught me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What meaneth it, father?” interposed the wondering
Hellen.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is the Pelasgian custom in storms, Hellen. Tell
him, Sensel.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will. But first, there is quite a vessel of oil upon
thy galley, Hellen, as I found when I was saving the
food from that torrent. It is for thee to order that a little
of that oil be dropped upon the water about thy galley
when we have done the like with this.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will to it, Sensel. But, meanest thou that the oil
hath the power to still the waves?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It hath.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It doth amaze.” Then, at Sensel’s behest, he stood at
that side of the galley toward his own, and slowly allowed
some drops to fall from the lamp upon the tumultuous
sea; and perceived that this small amount spread rapidly,
forming an expansive thin film upon the water.</p>

<p class='c011'>Meanwhile, with the second lamp, Sensel was acting
to as good purpose on the other side of the galley. For,
in scarce less time, was an even more expansive film
spreading from his side also. Then he called, “Hellen,
speak now to thy galley. The oil is in an earthen jar in
the hold. They are to drop it at each side.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The film was continuing to spread in a manner astonishing;
and more astonishing, the water about them was
unable to tear this film and send its wavelets to the crest.
The fierce sea was becoming subdued, threatening no
longer with its cresting waves. There was now but a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>swell that was growing less and less. As Hellen comprehended
this, a passion of hope possessed him. Enthusiastically,
he called to his galley, and gave commands
that those on board were quick to understand. For, in
scarce more than a minute were men stationed to pour
the precious drops on the cresting waves beneath.</p>

<p class='c011'>Meanwhile, the occupants of the other galleys were
watching, and gradually taking in this new position of
affairs. In a few minutes, there was not a galley but had
its men dropping oil; for each was supplied with lamps.</p>

<p class='c011'>And, oh the cheering that prevailed as the waves grew
quieter, as the blanket of oil—the thin, almost gossamer
film—continued to spread, the spreading so conquering
the waters that the other galleys soon lay at ease near
Hellen’s galley, in obedience to his command!</p>

<p class='c011'>When the ropes had well united the queen’s galley
with Hellen’s, Sensel called: “Now is the time. Thou
Deucalion, wilt bear the queen. Hellen, thou wilt lead
Electra. I will look to Æole and the ladies. And,
thou, Captain of the galley, wilt go over with us, and
take charge for the queen.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Quick,” added Hellen, nervously.</p>

<p class='c011'>The three ran to the withdrawing room, and each
seized his charge. The queen was still unconscious; but
to the others, explanations were made as they were hurried
along.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sensel, in delight that the calm was continuing, leaped
over, and then held out his arms, when, with Hellen’s assistance,
Æole was passed over. Then followed the
queen, Electra, and the ladies in waiting. Next was
transferred Deucalion’s boat.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then went over the captain of the queen’s galley with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>his men, the captain and men of Hellen’s galley taking
their places. Meanwhile, Hellen was gathering rugs and
cushions, and throwing these over. Even a few couches
were transferred. Then himself and Deucalion passed
over, after Azu.</p>

<p class='c011'>Immediately the men on Hellen’s galley bestirred themselves
to supply the queen’s galley and the now adjacent
other galleys with food, though small was the portion
allotted each. But, as Hellen had said, the African Coast
was not far; and several islands were between.</p>

<p class='c011'>Scarcely had all this been accomplished than a noise
as of muffled thunder was heard beneath the water, the
galleys receiving the shock as though they had struck
upon the rocks. Again the waters began to rage and
foam. The films of oil had yielded. Again were the
waves cresting, and most threateningly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Let us move on,” shouted Sensel. “And more oil!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The island!”—“The island!” cried a few agonized
voices.</p>

<p class='c011'>The island was shaking terrifically. And it had certainly
lost in height. Deucalion, as he looked, exclaimed
wildly: “Sensel—Hellen—it sinketh. It is lost!”</p>

<p class='c011'>He spoke very loud, forgetting himself, and the listening
islanders, in their amazement, concluded that the
time had arrived when the ‘Silent Priest’ could speak the
will of the gods.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He knoweth,” called one captain to the others. “Let
us press on!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yea—press on,” cried Deucalion in his mightiest
tone. “Further, forget not the oil!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then to Hellen and Sensel, he added, “Ye will press
on to the fifth island to the east, and there wait for me.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>I will take oil, food, and drink, and stay here in my boat,
that I may witness the death throes of the island.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will stay with thee,” said Sensel.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And I,” added Hellen.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will stay alone. Your duty is with those on this
galley. Hellen, call to mind that thy mother looketh
for thee and Æole.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She looketh for thee, likewise.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will come.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Hellen, of his impatience, turned away. He dared
not speak.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sensel, thou wilt aid Hellen in caring for Æole, Electra,
and the queen. Further, forget not to take in water
at that fifth island. It is fine.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Fierce was Hellen’s tone. “Father, if thou goest, I
go also. I will share thy watch!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nay, I will share it,” urged Sensel. “I came with
him. I stay with him to the end!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou art not his son!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hellen, calm thyself. I will bide alone. Look ye to
the queen, and to Æole and Electra. Bring me the food,
drink, and oil while I go to speak with them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>They gazed at him, irresolute. But, as he regarded
them, they at length turned to comply; whereupon, he
repaired to the withdrawing room to find that the queen
was still unconscious, whilst beside her sat Æole and
Electra. He took a hand of each, saying, “I would
speak with you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>When the ladies in waiting had withdrawn, he continued:
“Æole, Electra, gather your strength. I have
to tell you that I will stay here in my boat after the galleys
pass on to the east, that I may witness the last of
the island.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>They were bewildered. Thus, he repeated his words,
and with such conviction that they became horrified, and
piteously besought him not to leave them, not to go to
his death.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do ye not feel I shall come back? Æole, gather thy
trust. Electra, where is thy strength?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Gone, gone is my strength,” moaned Electra. “I
now know fear. Ah, Sir Deucalion, think of us. Yield
not to this wish. What is its furthering to the delight of
joining thy wife, of bringing before her Æole and Hellen.
And, tempt not the gods.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou meanest be not too sure of the favor of the
gods, Electra.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She blushed; but regarded him bravely. “I have said
it. Take it as thou wilt. Either is my thought.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou art a ready one. And I like thy truth. But
no talking will hold me. I go.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He took them in his arms, and kissed them. “Now
is my parting word for a little. But I shall come back.
And, give of this to the queen when I am gone, a drop
with every hour.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He laid a vial upon the  table; then led them to a
couch, and bade them comfort each other. They replied
not to him, but drooped their heads forlornly as he
passed out. As for Æole, she seemed turning to marble.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the threshold were awaiting Hellen and Sensel
with their supplies; and each looked most determined
as he passed onward. Then, Sensel knocked lightly at
the door, when Electra opened to them.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sensel hurried on toward Æole; but Hellen paused
by the door. “Electra, I go with my father. Sensel will
care for thee and Æole. And now to kiss thee. For
never shall I see thee more!”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>The last words seemed to tear him. Electra, pallid
and trembling, whispered: “Thou art right to go. But—the
pain!”</p>

<p class='c011'>He caught her to him, declaring how dear she was,
and begging she would not forget his love; then kissed
her, and ran out.</p>

<p class='c011'>Meanwhile, Sensel was pressing Æole’s hand so that
she revived, and looked up at him. At sight of the
anguish in her eyes, he forgot himself, and kissed her
hair, her hands, her robe, as he cried, “Æole—Æole!”</p>

<p class='c011'>She, flushing and paling, would have arisen. But he
said, “Nay, nay!” And after again kissing her hand,
sped to the door where he paused to bid farewell to
Electra, and then vanished.</p>

<p class='c011'>Deucalion stood at the stern. When they joined him,
he said as though giving some simple order, “Press on
to the island. There will I come to you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The two received his embraces, each biding his time,
each watching the other. Into the boat, they threw the
bags of food, the skins of water and wine; then, handing
him the oil, waited as he began the descent, each
purposing to throw himself after.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Deucalion was not half way, when, in the hush of
the amazed beholders, was heard a sharp cry from Electra.
Instantly, Hellen turned, and ran to the withdrawing
room. Thus Sensel found no bar to his resolve. In
a trice, he had leaped down beside Deucalion. “I came
with thee, I go with thee!” he cried. With this, he detached
the rope, and the boat tossed away.</p>

<p class='c011'>Deucalion, surprised at his insistency, demurred,
“Rash youth, rash prince, thy life is of too much
worth.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>Sensel smiled as he answered, “Is not thy life of
worth?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We shall have evil work.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It looketh it.” Then Sensel waved his hand gaily to
the astounded Hellen, who was looking over at them;
and who could only gasp, “Father!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is well. Be not troubled, my son. Think of thy
mother. What aileth Electra?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Æole sleepeth as she did in the temple.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Again is it well. Should I know I could not come
out of this, I would cause her to awake. But, let her
sleep for three days, should I not come back. Then, the
written word I left for thee in my case will show thee
how to arouse her. Further, my son, press on with
speed. Show thy fond feeling for me in this. And forget
not, my last word is for thy mother.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Hellen could not reply; but merely waved his hand in
farewell. As the boat shot off, he turned away without
hope.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the galleys were awaiting his lead. Thus he imparted
the directions of his father to their occupants who
were regarding the returning boat in dismay.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then quickly certain whispers spread. Was the ‘Silent
Priest’ an evil spirit? And, was he going back to gloat
over the condition of their island? Or, was he indeed
of the gods, and going to aid? Nobles, elders, captains,
sailors, women and children were divided, some judging
him to be on the side of evil, others on the side of good.
But the majority inclined to the evil. However, his directions
must be followed, as whether good or evil, he
had shown proper knowledge of the fitness of the fifth
island as a stopping place. And much they needed the
water.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>After the opinions had been well expressed, they grew
mute, for the vessels began to labor eastward. It seemed
as though their eyes must remain with the island, their
heavy hearts drag them to the bottom. Alas, these poor
Atlanteans!</p>

<p class='c011'>When they had well gone on, Deucalion and Sensel
stayed their course; and shortly bounded back to the
place they had left, from there to watch the doomed
Atlantis! That is, to watch the points within their vision
of this great, this magnificent island.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XVII.<br /> <span class='large'>THE SINKING OF THE ISLAND.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The two watchers were interested not only in the
island, but also in the galleys speeding eastward. Erelong,
the galleys that had turned back thought better of
their resolution; and changed course again in order to
rejoin their fellows But one continued toward Atlantis,
that containing Celesa’s relatives; and soon this disappeared,
thus leaving Deucalion and Sensel sole spectators
of the sequel of this frenzy of the elements.</p>

<p class='c011'>Through the night, the island seemed as if afire from
the continual thunderbolts and the volcano’s stream.
The fiery river of the latter had coursed down mountain
and hill to the sea, and was leaping the cliffs a tremendous
fall of flame; whilst the released gases, in their detonation,
outrivaled the thunder. And waterspout was
succeeding waterspout, each discharging its angry contents;
the rain, meanwhile, falling as do the avalanches.
It was indeed a deluge.</p>

<p class='c011'>Toward dawn, Sensel inquired, “Would it not be well
to get farther away? Should the island sink we are too
near.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There is yet time. Ah, the island rocketh again!
Sensel, my heart faileth me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The poor islanders! They merit it not.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The gods know.” Yet Deucalion’s face was drawn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>in agony. As for Sensel, his pallor was extreme. For
many minutes, neither spoke; and their eyes were turned
from the dreadful sight. Then Sensel said, “Let us beseech
that they come out of this.” And he fell to plead
silently, Deucalion emulating him. In the bounding boat,
the two found it hard to keep on their knees as they implored
heaven’s mercy, and hoped it would come.</p>

<p class='c011'>But mercy was not for the island. They gave up
hope when another volcano shot up, and poured its torrent
broadcast to the left of the first. Then said Deucalion,
“Let us press on until the island looketh to be on
the line where sky and water meet.”</p>

<p class='c011'>When thus well away, they stood in the tossing boat,
and gazed long, in mute anguish, for the island though
ceasing to rock, had sunk far down in the water—was
still sinking. Then their exhausted frames insisted upon
support. So they broke their fast, refreshing themselves
with the bread, dried meat, pulse, fruit, and wine. “Soon
shall we need our strength,” said Deucalion. “For the
end is near.”</p>

<p class='c011'>By judicious use of the oil, the tempestuous waves
were kept in abeyance. Thus they watched until the
early morning, amidst the din of the rumblings underneath,
explosions of gases, burstings of waterspouts, and
crashings of thunderbolts. The island was scarcely visible
for the great white waves leaping high upon it. The
heavens were lurid with the volcano’s flames; and two
broad torrents of molten, fiery matter were springing
from the island to the sea, that answered in tornadoes of
spray. Whilst the dense vapors rolling toward them
threatened to shut off the spectacle entirely.</p>

<p class='c011'>Through all, the doomed mass was slowly, determinedly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>sinking down—down—into the mad waters, the
consolidating thunderbolts seeming to press upon it to
hasten its descent. The vapors, in their thickening,
obliged Deucalion to move the boat from point to point
in order to retain the view of what was now but the
elevated portions of the island. A few times had this
been done when there came a shaking so excessive in its
length and severity that the two shrieked and closed
their eyes. When they looked, the island was disappearing
even to the peaks. In an instant more it vanished!
And the waters lashed over it in a vortex threatening
all things—a vortex flame, steam, and smoke mounted!</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now will we fly,” shouted Deucalion, “or we shall
follow the island. Scarce will the oil be of use!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Though Sensel continued to drop, as Deucalion began
his management. The boat bounded over the water,
hardly touching it. It seemed to fly. As Sensel watched,
he became awed, so bird-like, so sentient were the movements
of the slender frame! The water frothing madly
about them might be the verge of the vortex! Would
its terrific suction seize them, bear them down to share
the fate of the vanished island? As they labored, they
scarce breathed of their dread.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the boat continued to respond to the promptings—bounding,
skimming, flying over the turbid, grasping
waters. A half hour’s intensity of labor brought them
relief. The sea was certainly less violent. At times, the
boat could even rest. With hope, they began to regard
each other as they relaxed a little in their efforts. Though
hardly could they dare to accept it, when there was no
longer any impetuosity of movement, but merely the
rocking and rolling of rough contact. Shortly, there was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>not even rocking or rolling, but rather a gliding. Then
fell they on their knees.</p>

<p class='c011'>And that night, slept peacefully, in turn,—as the boat
made good time, in the morning coming upon a region
of sunshine.</p>

<p class='c011'>Past island after island they speeded, keeping ever to
the east by means of Deucalion’s knowledge of the heavens,
as well as by a kind of rude compass known even in
those days. This was a magnetized needle floating in
water crosswise upon a reed.<a id='r23'></a><a href='#f23' class='c012'><sup>[23]</sup></a> For well were the properties
of the loadstone understood, and utilized.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the morning of the second day, they sighted the
vessels, that, with some escaped vessels of Chimo, lay
moored in a cove of the island indicated by Deucalion.
And then upon the two came a mighty dread. How were
they to tell these Atlanteans, these Atlanteans already
signaling to them gladly. Thus, in telltale manner, did
they slacken their oncoming, to the quick appreciation of
the impatient islanders. The waiting vessels showed only
despairing faces, as the boat more and more reluctantly
approached. Then, when within earshot, a few would-be
hopeful ones began to cry out welcomings and inquiries.</p>

<p class='c011'>Standing mute, downcast, Deucalion and Sensel moved
in among them. Though this was not enough; for there
came the cries, “The island—is it well?” “Tell us the
good word!” And so on.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet still continued Deucalion and Sensel mute.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then demanded a voice, “Tell us the worst!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That can I tell you,” answered Deucalion.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is it?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>“The island is no more. It hath sunk.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Wails, shouts of incredulity responded.</p>

<p class='c011'>Deucalion repeated his words, and convincingly.
There were no more incredulous tones, but instead despairing
cries, wails, groans, fierce imprecations. The
wildest sounds of woe prevailed. At length, the same
voice that had asked for the worst rang loud, imperative,
this time demanding silence. It proved to be that of the
captain of the queen’s galley. He agonized, but firm,
was standing out on the prow of Hellen’s galley; and
continued:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sir Priest, in truth, is Atlantis no more? Have a
care—there left we our dear ones.” His voice broke, but
he stood straight and strong.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Captain of the galley of the queen—thy wife, thy little
ones—are above. Look not for them—or the island—on
earth.” Deucalion’s tones were faltering, but he
also stood firm.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We have but thy word. How can we believe? I
cannot. I would see with mine own eyes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And I!” “And I!” rang many voices.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sir Captain, thy doubts are in reason. I should feel
as thou. It is but a short sail. Further, the queen should
hear of it from Atlanteans.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There were cries of approbation.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sir Captain, I ask that thou wilt lead a few galleys
back, bearing the nobles and elders who are with us
Their word the queen will believe.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Loud rang the cries of approbation.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is well. But what of the galley that went on to
Cleit?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We saw it no more.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>“It was lost?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Without doubt.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We may come upon some who live?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It cannot be.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We will go back.” Sorely overcome, the captain held
out a hand to one of the sailors, with this aid, tottered
from the prow to the deck, and then hid himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>After further deliberation, it was decided that the few
vessels should return at once, and all the others await them
here. Hard did Deucalion struggle with his impatience
to be off!</p>

<p class='c011'>Shortly, the two captains had again exchanged galleys.
When the captain of the queen’s galley was once more on
board his own, and had been supplied with food from the
plenteous stores of the Chimoan vessels, he moved off;
and was followed by two of the Chimoan vessels bearing
such of the nobles as would return. To dire sounds, the
three hastened away.</p>

<p class='c011'>When they were well off, Deucalion and Sensel went
on to Hellen’s galley, which lay quite to itself beyond
the others—the queen’s condition demanding this. Dimmer
and dimmer grew Sensel’s eyes, and more and more
fluttering his heart. Was it well with Æole? When
departing, her unconsciousness had been his comfort; but,
had such continued? Or, had she come out of it to
keenest suffering—not only for her father, but also for
himself? (This last thought, he held in humility, so little
did his selfhood prevail.)</p>

<p class='c011'>Continually was he imploring that she might still be
sleeping. But when beside the galley, his emotion became
most evident.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sensel, what aileth thee?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>“Æole—thinkest thou she still sleepeth?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Her sleep will not end until we are with her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Unless Hellen hath waked her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He then became as in a dream until Hellen’s voice
was heard in greeting, when he looked up to perceive
himself and Electra leaning over the galley’s side. Notwithstanding
the woe about them, the two were finding
it hard to restrain their joy. Near them were a few
nobles, and their attendants; farther back, stood the
captain and sailors;—and all statues of grief.</p>

<p class='c011'>Deucalion ascended; and was clasped in Hellen’s arms.
Sensel went up, still as in a dream; as in a vision beholding
Æole in repose upon the couch where he had left
her. But he was recalled by the grasp of Electra’s hand,
her words of welcome.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Electra, the sight of thee doth gladden. Almost
can I forget the horrors we have passed through.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sensel, we thought never to see thyself or Sir Deucalion
more on earth. Drear was our way over the waters.
And we reached this to learn there had been a dire rocking
of the land for days.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wonder that an island is left. But tell me, Electra,
how is it with Æole?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She sleepeth as doth the babe in the arms of its
mother.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The color flashed over his face, the light into his eyes.
He was so transfigured that Electra stared at him.
“Sensel, art thou not wearied after thy watching?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wearied! I feel as though I had come out of a long,
sweet sleep.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And now, Hellen was seizing his hand. The two embraced
as Deucalion and Electra spoke together.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>“Electra, Æole doth still sleep?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She doth.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And the queen?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She aroused but to faint again; and hath lain in a
stupor through the night.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We will hasten to her,” spoke Deucalion hurriedly.
“But first, Æole.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Æole lay as marble on a couch near that of the queen.
Indeed, her immobility would have alarmed one not acquainted
with the idiosyncrasies of her case. But, in her
cheeks, was a reassuring, faintest tinge of pink, and her
lips retained their color and dewiness. It was as though
a rare statue was becoming replete with life; and these
beholding, continued to gaze in admiring wonder tinctured
with awe.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sensel’s face was a study in its love and thanksgiving.
He could not raise his eyes from this enthrallment.</p>

<p class='c011'>After one keen look, Deucalion bowed his head as if
satisfied, and whispered: “I will first look to the queen.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He found Atlana’s set face like that of death, and
instantly was applying restoratives. Then leaving Rica
and Elna to chafe her hands, he returned beside Æole.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sensel seized his hand. “Ah, Deucalion, what a power
is thine!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yea, Father. But, how camest thou by it? Never
hath the like been known in Atlantis. Else those priests
would not have been mastered.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Long hath it been mine, Hellen. Though I know
not what it is. It must be a hidden force of nature that
few hold. Often through it have I soothed thy mother.
And, when Æole was a child, I used it upon her when
she was hurt, and in pain. With her, there came a state
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>like sleep. Again I used this force when she was called
into the inner holy place; and to my amaze. But, it is
a dread power. Such evil could come of it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I can well see that,” said Sensel.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hush, hush,” here whispered Electra.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yea, hush ye all. Æole doth waken.” And Deucalion
leaned over her, the while signing for them to
withdraw.</p>

<p class='c011'>The color was deepening, the eyelids fluttering, the
lips parting. Scarcely were they outside, than she
opened her eyes. A joyous smile lighted her face at
sight of this dear father; and she held out her arms.</p>

<p class='c011'>When they had embraced, he raised her to a sitting
posture, and supported her. She said, in glad tone,
“Father, thou didst not go. It was good of thee to
hearken unto us.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But, I did go. And have but now come back.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou art pleased to jest. Is jesting a habit of the
Pelasgians? I thought them a people sober of mind.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He laughed. “Æole, thy chiding is fitting. But, I
say again that I have but just come back. I caused thee
to sleep.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“As thou didst in the temple?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yea.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I did not feel it come upon me. Why is that?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know not. I know this—thou yieldest well.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Father, thou art an able one. It is well thou couldst
do it, for my pain would have been sore. Yet, Hellen
and Electra, how bore they it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, as I knew. Each had the other.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But—Sensel?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sensel went with me.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>“Father!”—There was a fine condensation of amazement,
horror, reproach.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was not of my will. He and Hellen were strong
in saying they would go, when Electra screamed because
thou hadst fallen into this sleep. Thou shouldst have
seen Hellen. Forgetting me, he darted to her. Here
was the chance for Sensel. He leaped down beside me,
and loosed the boat. I could but yield.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was wrong of thee, of him. There are other things
than that island. Thou shouldst have turned back
rather than have risked a life so young and noble as that
of Sensel. And, for thee—thou wouldst have bereft a
waiting, sorrowing wife and fond children. Should not
wife, children, Sensel, have had more weight than the fate
of fifty islands? Father, I thought better of thee!”</p>

<p class='c011'>He rubbed his hands hard in his satisfaction. “That
is right, Æole. I merit thy chiding. Yet I could not but
go. It is worth the going to hearken to thy scolding.”
His eyes were twinkling.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A fine thing will it be to tell mother.” Then her
voice lowered in dread. “If she be but well? If she
hath not sunk beneath her woe? The doubt doth torture.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Deucalion shivered. He also was doubting; though
she must not know. Thus he insisted:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Æole, the gods can but bring joy to thy mother.
Never hath she murmured, never hath her trust lessened.
But come. Let us go out into the air.” (Though
he turned for the moment aside.)</p>

<p class='c011'>The queen was stirring; her eyes were opening.
Before passing out, Deucalion whispered to her ladies,
“She is better. When she rouseth, say not aught of
what hath happened.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>They went out to come upon Sensel who was standing
near the door. At sight of Æole, he hastened to draw
a couch more under the awning, with the words,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Æole, thou wilt find ease on this.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Much wondering at the sudden exhilaration possessing
her, she sat down.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Æole, thou art well?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“In truth am I.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She is well, and even strong enough to hear of the
past night,” said Deucalion, roguishly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Father!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Æole!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I asked thee not of the island. How could I forget!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou hadst much to do in chiding. Now will Sensel
tell thee. I go to Hellen and Electra.” And off he
moved toward the other couple, who, at sound of his
footsteps, faced him; and both exclaimed, “There is
Æole!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yea, she is well wakened.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The two laughed gaily, then, blushing, looked off on
the water. Though soon spoke Electra.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sir Deucalion, we would hear of the past night.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“For that I have come.”</p>

<p class='c011'>In a few words, he described the sinking of the island.
When he had finished, Hellen reproached him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Father, thou didst dare too much. What pain hath
it caused Electra and myself.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I knew ye would cheer each other. Further, there
was the thought for the queen.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“In truth, it was dire thought for her, for thee, and for
Sensel, day and night,” spoke Electra. “It was not
right of thee!”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>“Now is thy time, Electra, to chide, to scold. Already
hath Æole done her part. I will hearken well, for I
merit all.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“If she can scold who hath lain in her sleep, free of
dread, what might I say who have been waking through
it all. Sir Deucalion, I will seal my lips. I should say
too much.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Right, Electra, say no more,” interposed Hellen.
“Or, I, too, will join thee. But, father, instead, will I
speak of Electra. Without her, I could not have borne
it. Though she was torn with grief, she waited upon the
queen, helped the ladies, cheered poor Azu who hath
been stricken over the queen; and at times, walked with
me talking in bright manner—and to the helping of the
captain and sailors—for the captain told me they watched
her white robe as it were a beacon.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But I knew she would do thus, Hellen.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ye will spoil me. I have done but what I should.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Deucalion was suddenly falling into revery. Hellen
was about to address him, when Electra checked him.
Then the two began to pace about the deck, ever regarding
him anxiously. After a little, Electra whispered:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thy mother?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yea, he is lost upon her. The fear is great, at times,
that she may have passed beyond.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The gods are kind, Hellen. Ye will see her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Meanwhile, Sensel was giving his account to Æole.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Æole, we staid to see the island beset by high pillars
of water, pressed upon by bolts of flame, and as if on fire
from the burning mountain. The seething waves were
leaping higher and higher upon it: and it was plain it
was sinking. Later, another mountain began to send
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>forth fire. Imagine, if thou canst, those fiery streams
rising high above the island to fall in rivers of flame, that
rushed in fury onward to the cliffs—from there to leap to
the mad waters that answered in tempests of boiling, hissing
spray! And through all was the noise deafening.
Ever were the pent airs<a id='r24'></a><a href='#f24' class='c012'><sup>[24]</sup></a> bursting from the mountain with
noise as of thunder, the pillars of water breaking, the bolts
of flame crashing—whilst the rain fell in sheets, the ashes
in showers!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Did the rain and ashes fall upon you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They touched us not to our wonder.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Æole sighed, relieved; then shivered.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is too much for thee, Æole.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Say on, Sensel. I would hearken to all.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The island was sinking fast, whilst toward us speeded
dense vapors that we feared would hide the end. Thus
we moved from point to point that we might still behold.
Though not for long: as, in the early morning came the
end. There was a long and severe trembling—as if
heaven and earth were rending apart! We closed our
eyes knowing the worst had come. We opened them to
behold the island vanishing!</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yea, in a moment more, we saw it not—saw naught
but the meeting waters, the whirl of their drawing—with
flame and smoke rising high above! Then cried thy
father, ‘Now will we fly!’—And amazing became his
guiding of the boat. We bounded, leaped, flew, scarce
touching the hungry waves that we feared would draw
us down. Long we thought we should not get beyond.
But the boat is charmed. And so is thy father. We
bounded, leaped, flew on—on—to less raging waters;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>thence to smooth ones; later sighting these vessels to be
stricken with further dread. For, how were we to tell
these Atlanteans that their island was no more?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah—how?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Though thy father did it, Æole.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The poor Atlanteans!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Æole, through it all, thou wert of more thought than
the island. Ever was I fearing thou wouldst come out
of thy sleep. As I helped thy father, I was dwelling
upon thy grief shouldst thou waken ere we reached thee.
Less worked I for life than for thy peace of mind.
Though life is without price whilst thou art of it. Now,
it is past belief that I am with thee, that peace and joy
are our own, that I hold thy hand, that I kiss it thus!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Æole had never seen anything so beautiful as his
smile. She looked down at her hand, then at his; and
upon her came the desire to kiss this hand so enfolding
hers. But, her look was more than many kisses, as she
said: “Sensel, our lives will prove our thanks.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Our life, Æole.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Now upon his ears smote sore interruption. The
voices of Hellen and Electra were very near. Thus he
murmured, “There can be but one life for us, Æole.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then in came the two under the awning. They sat
down unmindful of the agitation of Sensel and Æole,
being all occupied with their own sweet emotions. But,
they began to speak of the events of the night; and
Sensel, in greatest patience, replied to their questions.
Glad was he when Deucalion appeared. Then he excused
himself. And, when outside, fell to pacing the deck absorbed;
at times, pausing to gaze in somnambulistic
fashion upon the water.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>Under this awning, the evening meal was partaken of.
This consisted of bread, pulse, dried meats, honey, melons,
pomegranates, wine, and a sherbet made of almonds
and honey—so well were the fleeing Chimoan vessels
victualed, so generous was the fifth island in its offerings
of fruit.</p>

<p class='c011'>Moreover, Azu served them. He was quite himself
now that Deucalion had assured him the queen would
recover, that he would again bear her train. Though,
in this serving, his lurches threatened the gravity of the
eaters full as much as the downfalling of the things he
bore. Indeed, not a few of the latter came to grief, thus
conducing to the lightening of spirit of those being
served. Azu was Azu.</p>

<p class='c011'>The night was soft and bright, to the comfort of Deucalion,
Sensel, and Hellen, who reposed on couches
under the awning, using the rugs as coverings. The
oarsmen spread themselves about the deck. As to the
ladies, they were well housed in the withdrawing room.</p>

<p class='c011'>Every night was as this in temperature. Never a cloud
obscured the heavens. Thus were they favored.</p>

<p class='c011'>But a few more days, and the sails of the three returning
vessels were sighted. Then, as had been agreed, all
the waiting vessels save the one containing the queen,
went noiselessly out to meet them. Laggard was the
approach of these three: and this told the story. At
last they met, far out on the water.</p>

<p class='c011'>The queen’s galley was ahead of the other two; and,
at its prow, stood the bowed form of the captain. Now
was the worst verified!</p>

<p class='c011'>They called on him to speak.</p>

<p class='c011'>Slow were his words in coming: though, they burst
forth with frantic vehemence.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>“Atlanteans, we hearkened unto the truth! Our island
hath vanished—all save the highest peaks<a id='r25'></a><a href='#f25' class='c012'><sup>[25]</sup></a> far to the
northeast! Scarce could we push to where it hath lain
for the mud and ashes that thicken the water!—And
dead men fill the sea even as the fishes!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XVIII.<br /> <span class='large'>PYRRHA.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Soft continued the nights and bright the days as they
sailed by the islands, and along the Afrite Coast. Quick
were they in sighting the green gay Atlas Mountains,
and then Cape Spartel. Upon viewing the latter, intense
became Deucalion’s emotion. With eyes eager
and face flushing, he cried in husky tones: “Ah Æole,
Hellen, now is your mother near! With what a heart I
passed yon point to go onward to Atlantis! Sensel, can
we ever forget?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Sensel could reply only by pressing the hands held
out to him. Then, with moistening eyes, both watched,
as did the three beside them.</p>

<p class='c011'>On they pressed into a strait; and toward a point on
the African Coast, the ancient Abyla and the Ape’s Hill
of the moderns. Nine miles across lay the great rock,
afterward named Alube by the Phœnicians, and Calpe
by the Greeks. It is the Gibraltar of to-day.</p>

<p class='c011'>These two points, the Rock of Gibraltar and Ape’s
Hill, constituted the ancient Pillars of Hercules. Not
that the Greek hero had any part in their naming.
Rather they were named for the Tyrian deity whose
worship the Phœnicians introduced into all their settlements.
Long after the sinking of Atlantis, in a forgetting,
perhaps unbelieving age of maritime sloth, these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>Pillars, the guards of the Mediterranean, came to be considered
the ends of the earth. Thus sank the glories of
the island into fable!</p>

<p class='c011'>When well off Abyla, the vessels steered northward
toward the famous Rock, the rock that was raising its
mammoth proportions high—that rock that has since
been called “a mountain of histories”—the rock that
was overshadowing the waiting ones!</p>

<p class='c011'>Eyes hopeful yet fearing, eyes sad to desperation, were
fixed upon it—every heart throbbed wild—as the vessels
crossed the waters of the strait to the green and gray
coast from which the Great Rock jutted invitingly in its
virgin stillness, even then exerting its strange fascination:
a fascination that would impel to itself the Saracen
Tarik, thousands of years later; a fascination that would
cause Moor and Christian to engage in warfare, as the
years went on; a fascination that would bring contention
between Christian Spain and Christian England in the
Middle Ages; a fascination that would draw upon itself,
in modern times, that memorable, terrible siege of four
years when French and Spanish exhausted their resources
but to prove its latent magnetism—in that it continued to
hold, against all odds, the English garrison that had so
long nestled in its rugged bosom!</p>

<p class='c011'>On their right, spread the beauteous Mediterranean;
on the left, was a small bay toward which lay the
Rock’s only sloping side. Erelong, all eyes began to
ask of Deucalion which course should they take, this
Deucalion who was standing so motionless with rapt
face. Before them was the south end of the Great Rock,
steep, precipitous, inaccessible; and upon its grim height
they began to look in fear. Should they go to its left or
its right?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>But, when the moment came, Deucalion was ready to
give the order. “Behold, the point on the right. That
will we round. There left we the vessels. Æole, Hellen,
then shall we sight them!”</p>

<p class='c011'>So extreme was his agitation, that they forgot their
fears in desiring to calm him. Bravely Æole spoke:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yea, Father, mother is there—as thou didst say.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yea, mother is there,” echoed Hellen.</p>

<p class='c011'>“As I did say,” murmured Deucalion vaguely. Then
he closed his eyes, for they were drawing very near.
Already the Great Rock seemed looming over them.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Round that point, Hellen, with speed,” he aroused to
command. “Then shall we behold them!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Hellen’s galley rounded the point, but not speedily;
rather slowly, timidly. Would the vessels of Pyrrha and
her friends be there moored? Would Pyrrha appear
in answer to their shouts?</p>

<p class='c011'>In the moment of rounding, none of these interested
ones dared raise their eyes. But blessed sounds broke
from the Atlantean sailors. In this moment of rounding,
they burst into cheers, for all their saddened hearts.
Then the fearing ones took courage. They lifted their
eyes; they looked; they beheld the Pelasgian vessels
lying as if enchanted on the bright, smooth waters of the
beautiful haven.</p>

<p class='c011'>The cheerings strengthened as the other vessels also
rounded. These mighty tones quickly brought life to
the enchanted vessels. Their decks filled with patient,
faithful, loving ones whose joyous welcomings answered
these newcomers—these returning Pelasgians, these sad-eyed
Atlanteans.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Deucalion, Æole and Hellen stood faint—waiting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>for the one form to appear. The moments seemed ages.</p>

<p class='c011'>Though surely the hurrying of a few officers below on
Pyrrha’s vessel boded good. The three strained their
eyes for the view of that dear form when it should hasten
to respond. Holding each other tight, they reeled, when
an officer returned, leading, rather supporting a white-robed
lady. That was she. That was the wife! That
was the mother! Deucalion and his children staggered
to the edge of the prow, to wave and kiss their hands.
And it was “Pyrrha, wife!” “Mother!” “Mother!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Pyrrha raised her head, and looked; and ran, weeping
her thanks, to lean far over the vessel’s side, and hold
out her arms.</p>

<p class='c011'>On went the galleys toward her. When Hellen’s was
alongside, the rope thrown, and the plank laid, such a
speeding across as there was by Deucalion and Hellen,
with Æole between.</p>

<p class='c011'>Pyrrha awaited at the end of the plank. The spectators,
as one, burst into cheers, when the four met and
entwined. Though their fears were for the mother.
Would she faint, perhaps sink under her happiness?</p>

<p class='c011'>And indeed dizziness did overcome Pyrrha for the
moment. But Deucalion held her; and whispered reviving
words. Besides, these were her children kissing her
hands, her face, her hair, her robe, and calling in heavenly
fashion, “Mother!” “Mother!”</p>

<p class='c011'>So she strengthened to weep of her joy; to look from
Hellen to Æole, from Æole to Hellen in wonderment, so
striking was their beauty, aye, better still, their nobility,
their purity of expression.</p>

<p class='c011'>And these children, in transport, were gazing upon
their mother. They had borne into captivity an enduring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>remembrance of her grace, nobility and beauty; but the
remembrance was as naught to this reality. They could
not take their eyes from her; and, at last, Hellen exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mother, how fair, how grand art thou. Sorrow hath
not marred, but glorified thee!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She is a bright spirit,” added Deucalion. “Nay,
Pyrrha, thou art a goddess.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hail to the goddess Pyrrha!” cried Hellen.</p>

<p class='c011'>At this, the officers and crew of Pyrrha’s vessel shouted
as one, “Yea, yea, hail to the good goddess, Pyrrha!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They know thee, dear Wife,” whispered Deucalion,
“the <i>good</i> fitteth well.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But Pyrrha knew she was not good—that none are
good save the Divine. She could not <i>be</i> good, but she
could <i>do</i> good through the Divine influx.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet these exaggerated expressions were dear, coming
as they did of love. For ever is love precious. So she
received them, blushing even as a girl. No fear was there
now of her fainting. Strong she stood with an arm
about each child as the friends from the neighboring vessels
came aboard to greet her husband. Sensel came
also to clasp her hand, and glide away.</p>

<p class='c011'>Very soon Hellen went to bring Electra. When this
beauteous maiden bent before her, Pyrrha gazed surprised,
admiring; and next held out her hand and drew
her to her to kiss her well. Still retaining the hand, she
asked of Deucalion, “Are all the Atlanteans like this?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Would that they were. The spirit of Electra is as fair
as is her body of flesh. With them the outer body was
fair, but the inner one had become evil of shape. Moreover
Electra hath in her veins the best blood of Atlantis
and Khemi.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>“Hath she parents?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Her parents are above. There were Alto the king
and his two brothers. Alto was the father of the last
king, Atlano. The wife of King Atlano was Atlana, the
daughter of the second brother by a princess of Khemi.
The mother of Electra was the daughter of the third
brother and wife of a prince of Khemi; and her brother
was Oltis, the last high priest. Yet, though Electra was
a princess and his niece, Oltis placed her in the temple as
handmaid. From there, we freed her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why did Oltis thus?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He hated her father Cairais because Cairais well knew
his evil spirit. And he longed for the riches, that would
come to Electra. Further, he wished to trouble Queen
Atlana who loved Electra well, after her mother.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Father, sudden was the passing away of Cairais.
Could it be that Oltis poisoned him?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ask me not, Hellen.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“If Atlano had died, would Queen Atlana have
reigned?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I feel sure that she would, though she is not all Atlantean.
Hitherto, the kings and queens have been of
pure race. But the Atlanteans were so fond of Queen
Atlana that they would have made light of her Khemian
blood; and the more so that they hated Oltis.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Pyrrha had continued to hold Electra’s hand; and the
latter had been regarding her brightly in her lack of
comprehension of Deucalion’s and Hellen’s words. Thus
Pyrrha’s heart warmed the more.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Would that she knew our tongue, Deucalion.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It will come to her soon. In six months Sensel and
myself mastered Atlantean.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>Pyrrha looked again at Electra. It was strange how
this young girl attracted her. With growing delight,
Hellen watched his mother’s interest. As to Deucalion,
he was exultant—that is, within. Things were going as
he wished.</p>

<p class='c011'>For the next half hour, Deucalion was busy recounting
to Pyrrha and their tried friends the main events as
they had occurred since he parted from them. They
listened to exclaim continually. When he had finished,
for this time, he spoke in touching manner of his gratitude
to these dear Pelasgians, exalting their constancy to
Pyrrha and himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>In turn, Illyr and wife, Ephes and wife, Pelop and wife,
with their children, declared the stay with Pyrrha had
been a bright holiday, and that theirs was the pleasure
of gratitude. Stoutly they insisted that the obligation
was on their side. This sweet wrangling was to the keen
enjoyment of Hellen, who, with Æole and Electra, still
stood beside Pyrrha.</p>

<p class='c011'>But, where was Sensel? After kissing Pyrrha’s hand,
he had vanished, not to return. Repeatedly had Æole
looked about the vessel for him; and had as often wondered
if he were within the small cabin, or had gone below
to the sleeping apartments. At last, as she was
gazing wistfully at the stairway leading to the latter, she
perceived a head rising into view. But this was a head
on which was a cap of white linen with crown encircled
by a fillet of scarlet cloth that tied in a bow behind and
with ends depending!</p>

<p class='c011'>Moreover, this figure, as it further arose into view, displayed
a most elegant garb. There was a broad cape of
purple wool fitted to the shoulder, and reaching to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>waist; and adorned with yellow lace. Beneath, was a
coat of scarlet cloth fitting close to the body, opening in
front, and reaching to the knees. Still beneath was an
inner garment of yellow linen that fell in graceful fullness
to the ankles. About the waist was a golden girdle; and
shoes of red leather ornamented the feet.</p>

<p class='c011'>It took but a few moments to view all this. And ah,
but it was a rare figure and garb; and bewildering—for
the height was Sensel’s!—Further, were not these brilliant
eyes meeting hers, Sensel’s, also? Was not this his
smile?</p>

<p class='c011'>Her head swam as this noble, elegant, lissome shape
approached to bow gracefully, grandly to her and all.
Next, she began to wonder why everyone, even to her
father, should bend with utmost deference, in return.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Deucalion, who was much enjoying her perplexity,
hastened to explain.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Æole, Sensel hath left us. In his place is Prince
Pelasgus, the son of our king.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She closed her eyes, stunned. But the prince was
taking her hand. Thereupon, recovering somewhat, she
opened her eyes, looked at him calmly; and withdrawing
her hand, made a low obeisance. He was the prince.
He was not Sensel!—Though most unhappy thoughts
were crowding upon the shock of this revealment, she
managed to speak with sweet dignity.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Prince Pelasgus, this cometh upon me without warning.
Little dreamed I that Sensel was other than he
seemed.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Deucalion’s satisfaction was something to behold; and
this the keen-eyed Pelop laughed over to himself. For,
the former was thinking, “Æole is like her mother. She
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>will rise above the pressing weight ever.” Then aloud,
he added, in Atlantean, that Electra might be benefited.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yea, Æole, this is the young prince who shared with
me the perils of war, and who was firm in his wish to aid in
freeing thyself and Hellen. And, who, after short trial,
so ably took upon himself the shape of Sensel.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ever have I known the noble spirit of Sensel,” she
returned.</p>

<p class='c011'>“So ever have I,” interposed Electra. “Scarce did I
open mine eyes when I heard he was the prince.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou—didst know—he was the prince?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hellen told me but this morn.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why was not I told?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was for the reason that the prince wished thou
shouldst believe him but Sensel until we reached here.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“<i>But Sensel</i>”—Æole checking herself, turned to the
prince. “Why was this, Prince Pelasgus?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I knew that thou didst look upon Sensel with good
will; but I knew not how thou wouldst look upon the
prince.”</p>

<p class='c011'>A great load seemed lifted. She said naively, charmingly,
“Thou wert right to think I should like the old beyond
the new. There have been many princes, but never
another Sensel. Prince Pelasgus, ever shall I joy to think
of thee as Sensel. No higher thought could I have for
thee.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Over Sensel’s—Prince Pelasgus’ face passed a beautiful
glow, and his eyes shone with a loving light that all
might see. Pyrrha, comprehending, glanced at Deucalion,
to find him watching the two in delight. As to the
friends of their exile, they were receptive also.</p>

<p class='c011'>For one, the keen-eyed Pelop whispered to his wife:</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>“I see it. Those two are fond.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She was as interested. “They are a noble pair. And
most fair to look upon. May it be so. Well I like it
that his eyes are so dark, and hers so blue. As thine
and mine.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Pelop laughed to himself. Well he knew his Peloppa’s
taste for romance. Then he looked about with a view
to further discovery.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Look at Hellen. How he bendeth over that fair Atlantean.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is another pair, that I see. Ah, Pelop, but our
voyage over the Middle Sea will not drag!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Again Pelop laughed, and hugged himself; and said
with feeling, “We were young once, Wife.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And not so old now. Thou wilt speak for thyself;
and I for myself. Ah, but our own joy maketh me kind
to all who wish to pair. May I live to aid our children
along the same bright path!” And she looked at her
gamboling ones with the air of a prophetess.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If one were old enough now, Peloppa. But matters
will soon mend. And our Zoe will be another like thyself.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She is bright of mind.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She is.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She hath a quick tongue.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pelop!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And—a most tender heart.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is well thou didst add that.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And—she is one to hold most dear.” Here his tone
was such that Peloppa, in spite of the eyes about her,
could but put her hand within the one he so eagerly held
out.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>Then they forbore further talking in order to listen to
Deucalion, who, at inquiry of Epha, was again started
upon the subject of Atlantis; whilst Prince Pelasgus
talked with Pyrrha and translated much to Electra, who
stood with an arm about Æole.</p>

<p class='c011'>After a little, Pyrrha inquired of her husband, “When
can I see the queen?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“On the morrow, I hope. She is better, though she
seemeth to see no one about her, not even her ladies.
If she could but arouse. It may be that thou wilt do it,
that thou wilt bring her back to peace. She is lost in
grief.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The poor queen—without kin, without a land!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Poor people!” said Prince Pelasgus.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We will make it bright for them in Pelasgia,” spoke
Hellen.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We will,” declared Deucalion.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We will,” echoed all.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We know what it is to be strangers in a far land,”
added Hellen.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yet—we had our land to look to,” said Æole.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ho for Pelasgia!” cried these Pelasgians. And then
looked sadly over at the Atlantean vessels. As with one
impulse, they moved to the vessel’s side to watch the
Atlanteans long and affectionately; and thus adopted
them into their hearts.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Atlanteans appeared to understand, for they returned
the looking with smiles, sad though they were to
desperation. Not one of them but was mourning the
loss of near or dear ones. Indeed, many were envying
Celesa’s relatives, that they had returned. But their grief
must be in silence, for they yet had their queen.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>On the morn of the morrow, Pyrrha left her vessel
elated. At last she was to behold this woman who had
so tenderly cared for her children; and entered the
withdrawing room confident that she could help.</p>

<p class='c011'>As she passed on to the queen, Deucalion beckoned
for the ladies in waiting to come out. These, after listening
to his explanations, sat down under the awning, and
regarded each other in wonder. Was this Pyrrha—this
fair, grand, most lovable looking woman but one of a
type? If so, what a race was the Pelasgian, after Deucalion
and his children!</p>

<p class='c011'>Pyrrha stood beside the queen reverently, adoringly.
Indeed her love so went out from her as to affect the pale,
passive recipient. For Pyrrha had gazed but a little
while, when Atlana turned and looked full at her, and
this though she had come without noise.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of her amaze, the queen strengthened to raise somewhat,
and stare at the angelic face bending over her; and
finally whispered:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who art thou? Comest thou of the gods?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Though the tongue was unknown, Pyrrha comprehended.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Gracious Queen, I am of earth. I am one who holdeth
thee deep in her heart, whose prayers will ever call
down blessings upon thee, whose days and nights will be
favored in thanking thee.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou sayest thou art of earth?” asked Atlana in
Pelasgian, and so correctly that Pyrrha answered not for
wonder.—“Thou sayest thou art of earth?” she repeated,
after waiting.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dear Queen, I am of earth,—and until these last
weeks—one of its most sorrowing daughters.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>“Most sorrowing. Then know I how thou hast felt.
But—why wert thou sorrowing?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dear Queen, I was a mother bereft of her children.
Not that the gods had taken them to make Heaven more
dear. But, through war—through fierce, cruel man—had
they been torn from me!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Atlana was rising higher, was looking at her piercingly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dear Queen, it cometh to thee. Why should I hold
thee so dear, why should I bow down to thee—I, a
mother bereft of her children. Few such mothers are
there in this happy world!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou—art—not—?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But I am—I am! I am that mother who mourned
for her children, Hellen and Æole!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Atlana, who had raised until she was sitting erect,
burst into tears, weeping as if she could never cease.
Pyrrha, as she supported her, looked around for Deucalion;
and beheld him standing near the door, smiling.
He signed that it was well. So she began to dry the
queen’s tears, pausing at times to embrace her, upon
perceiving that such pleased her.</p>

<p class='c011'>Still the life-giving tears ran on, sobs coming heart-rendingly,
so that Deucalion looked upward to murmur:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thanks, ye Powers! And let the stream run long
and fast. Let it be the beginning of life to the desert
place. May that parched field, her mind, be so well
watered that new flowers of hope may bloom again, and
shed their fragrance upon her sad Atlanteans. Ah, poor
queen, poor people!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Long was it before the tears were spent. Then
Atlana put out her hand for Pyrrha’s. “I would kiss
thee,” she murmured.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>Pyrrha leaned over. When Atlana had kissed her
cheek, she pleaded, “Thou wilt not leave me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dear Queen, from now, am I thy sister, nurse.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ever wilt thou be my sister. But not for long my
nurse. Already, I feel new life. And thou hast caused
it—thou—sweet spirit—thou—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pyrrha, call me Pyrrha.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou—sweet Pyrrha—thou mother of Æole and
Hellen.” So lovingly lingered she over these names that
Pyrrha kissed her again and again, while Atlana sighed,
content. Afterward, she asked as a child might, “Am I
to know rest again? Long is it since I have felt such
ease?. I could sleep. Should I, dear Pyrrha, thou wilt
not loose my hand?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nay, dear Queen. I will but hold it closer.”</p>

<p class='c011'>With the confidence of a child, Atlana pressed the
hand to her heart, and lay back passive, drowsy, shortly to
slumber so serenely that Pyrrha marveled.</p>

<p class='c011'>Soon Deucalion drew near. “All will be well,” he
whispered, “but how knew she our tongue? Never was
I so wondering!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nor I, though I knew she had studied it, so well did
she speak. Only this morning Æole told me that, when
herself and Hellen had learned somewhat of Atlantean,
the queen began to study Pelasgian. Thus, it came to
pass that, on the one day, they would talk in Atlantean;
and, on the next, in Pelasgian.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“As thou sayest, she speaketh it well.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She looketh wise; and, of a truth, is sweet and fond.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, Pyrrha, such a heart is hers. But it was wasted
on her husband. How hath she missed the good thing
in life. Atlano could care but for himself.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>At this dread name, Pyrrha shivered. Deucalion put
his arm about her, and bade her lean upon him. Then
she whispered, “Ah poor queen, life hath not been life
to her! To be so fond, and have naught but a stone!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Say, rather, life is not life to the one who is not fond.
Life was not life to Atlano. Life is not life to the wife or
husband who knoweth not tender feeling. Such pluck
but dead fruit.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah but thou speakest truth. With each moment of
our wedded life how glad have I been that thou wert so
dear. All bitter hath had its sweet. Though grief hath
held me, yet have I had thee to think upon, to look for,
to hearken unto.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yea, and to joy in, for of me art thou sure. To think
I have come into heaven again! And from hell. Ah,
that island, Pyrrha, that fair Atlantis! The thought of it
cometh upon me strong at times, so that I find it hard to
bear up. That fair, grand, most favored spot—a heaven
but for man!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus, on they talked—of past horrors, of the present
brightness, of the happiness fore-gleaming from their children’s
hopes—until the queen began to stir. Her restlessness
increased. Erelong, she was turning toward
them. After an intent look, she extended her hand to
Deucalion.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wronged thee,” she murmured. “Forgive.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Gracious Queen, I have naught to forgive. We will
be but the dearer friends. It is all in knowing the right.
Thou hast thought it over since.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well and long have I thought it over. And I know
the worst. Think not I have been deaf whilst lying here.
My body hath been as a stone, but the mind hath been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>quick. My poor Atlanteans! Oh, to be of help to them!
We are bereft, bereft!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then—thou knowest?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yea, whilst lying here, I have heard that within and
without to make me know our island is no more.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Some of thy people are left thee.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Call them not people. Call them Atlanteans. It is
the dearer name. We are of Atlantis—though it is no
more.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dear Queen Atlana, thy thought for these thy Atlanteans
will make it well for thee. Thy wish to cheer them
will bring thee cheer. Cheer cometh in giving cheer.
And, here is Pyrrha for thy sister. Erelong we hope to
see thee thine old self.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Never, Sir Deucalion, can I be mine old self. Mine
old self was full of hope, of joy, of sweet, warm feeling.
Mine own self! Ah, I am dead—dead!”</p>

<p class='c011'>She leaned back, and closed her eyes. Deucalion
pressed her wasted hand and spoke in softest tone, with
intent to bring her out of her sad thought.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dear Queen, I should have said a little like thine old
self. That will be much. And now I would warn thee
when next thou seest me, I will be more of my old self—in
garb. I shall be no priest of Poseidon. I shall be
in Pelasgian dress, fairer of skin, and shorn of this beard.
I would not change until thou couldst be told.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“In any dress, thou art Deucalion, the kind, the noble.
Pyrrha, how blest art thou! But go, Sir Deucalion, that
I may soon behold thee as Pelasgian. Whilst thou art
gone, I will look at Pyrrha.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not this day, dear Queen. But on the morrow.
Though now will I leave thee that thou mayst look upon
Pyrrha.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XIX.<br /> <span class='large'>THE BEGINNING OF PEACE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The next morning, the vessels began their course up
the Middle Sea. And with what a difference in the hearts
they carried. Truly the Pelasgian vessels were bearing
feathers, the Atlantean vessels stones. Alas for these
poor Atlanteans! Well did their vessels, even in their
port, testify to the weighty spirits of those aboard them,
for they ploughed the water unwillingly, heavily.</p>

<p class='c011'>Later in the day, the noblest of Pelasgians appeared
before his children and Electra to dazzle their eyes;
whereupon, Hellen after much interchange of criticism
with Æole, asseverated:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, father, we would have known thee but for the
beard. That it was that hid thee.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But Electra said nothing so engrossed was she with
the beauty of each separate feature. Now were disclosed
the noblest of chins, the firmest, kindest of mouths, the
perfect contour, the strength and sweetness of expression,
the high purpose. She could not gaze enough.</p>

<p class='c011'>And thus felt Queen Atlana when Deucalion presented
himself in this beautiful costume much like that of
Prince Pelasgus, the difference being that there was less
of trimming, and that the cape and coat were of one
color, a rich deep blue. It was fine to see her admiration,
finer to hear it expressed. Thus, Deucalion really
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>blushed, and to steady himself, said, “Ah, dear Queen, if
thou thinkest this so fine, wait until I bring before thee
two noble youths of Pelasgia, which will be on the morrow,
if thou art willing.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who are they?” she asked absently, in her study of
his grand beauty.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The first is young Prince Pelasgus, the son of our
king. The second is my Hellen. Then wilt thou behold
garbs.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dear Hellen! I can see him, as he will look. But
when came this young Prince Pelasgus?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is a year since he first saw Atlantis.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What sayest thou?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is a year since he went with me to Atlantis—a year
since he began to serve in the temple—but a few months
since thou didst see fit to praise him. Call to mind his
tall shape, his garb of dust color, his shining eyes, his
tender tones, his smile, the grace of his swaying body.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was most evident that Atlana called all this to mind,
so overwhelmed did she show herself. She could only
implore him by a gesture to continue.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yea, dear Queen, young Prince Pelasgus came upon
the island with me as Sensel. Well had he served with
me in war; and fond did we grow of each other. When
I would come after my children, he would come with me
in the shape of Sensel. And, as thou shouldst know,
well did he aid me. Though little canst thou, or any
other, know what he hath been to me. But for him I
could not have mastered.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I believe it, Sir Deucalion.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She pondered awhile; and then said, “I would see the
Pelasgian youths now.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>“Dear Queen, on the morrow. It is enough for this
day.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She acquiesced, bending her head; and lay back in a
sweet quiet, shortly whispering, “On the morrow.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And on the morrow, did these youths of Pelasgia kneel
before her.</p>

<p class='c011'>First entered the prince in his brightness, elegance,
grace, and beauty. Charmingly he knelt to kiss her
hand, his courtesy so affecting her that a faint smile came
into her face as she gave him greeting.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Hellen followed, kneeling and taking her other
hand. Thus, the smile blended with glad tears. Here
was her handsome, brave, impulsive, fiery Hellen, clad in
blue and buff, and looking a young demi-god in his rebound
to freedom and happiness. His face was transfigured;
and hers grew in brightness as she greeted him.
And she thought, as she pressed the two hands, “Am I,
in truth, to smile again?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then in her gracious way she spoke. “Noble youths
of Pelasgia, with fond pride is my greeting. But rise
that I may look with even more pride upon you, that I
may feast my eyes upon your brave, free port.—Ah,
what garments!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Gleeful was their laughter. Whereupon, she smiled
back quite in her olden way.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What thrills of joy ye cause me. Ah, Hellen—Hellen!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Fine is it to be thus looked upon,” burst from him
naively. “All day could I hearken to thy praises. And
to think I am that Hellen,”—he paused, fearing to bring
sad thought to her forgetting self, and changed, “that
Hellen, who, but yesterday, was lamenting his old garments,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>who feared to put them on so worn were they,
who was lost in wondering where others would come
from. When behold, this morning, did my father bring
me these.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was not that his garments were so old,” interposed
Deucalion, “but that he was rent with envy upon beholding
me in my change of garb, yesterday.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Have it thus, if thou wilt, father. It is rising high to
envy thee in any state, or garb.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is well said, Hellen,” spoke the queen. “But I
know thine envy hath for meaning the wish to be like
him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He will never reach to his wish,” said Prince Pelasgus,
solemnly. “That is for me. For I hold Deucalion
more dear even than doth he.”</p>

<p class='c011'>At this calumny, Hellen made as if he would dart
upon him; whereupon, he took to his old posturing and
evading. Then the two burst into laughter. It was
plain they were the best of friends. This so pleased the
queen that she declared:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now is my spirit cheered to the full. Or will be
when I have looked upon Æole and Electra. Where are
they?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Immediately two glad voices cried from without the
door, “Here!” “Here!”</p>

<p class='c011'>In a trice, their arms—the arms of these two young girls
she had so befriended and suffered for—were about her,
their fervent kisses on brow, lip, and cheek.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dear Queen!” “Dear Queen!” they cried.</p>

<p class='c011'>She embraced one, and then the other. Speak she
could not. Then she lay back to marvel at the change
that happiness had effected—even in them. In their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>white, flowing robes and golden girdles, with long waving
hair crowned with chaplets of flowers—flowers
brought from beside the Great Rock in the early morning
by Hellen and Sensel—with eyes lustrous from rest,
happiness, and young love, they were beauteous as Aurora
when she early treads her golden days!</p>

<p class='c011'>And these lovely flowers they were pressing into her
hands but completed the spell. Supreme became her
satisfaction, her delight. Surely now had come compensation.
Here were these four youthful ones, here were
Deucalion and Pyrrha, here were flowers that of themselves
brought peaceful rapture. No, her suffering had
not been for naught. A tide of thanksgiving surged in
her heart; and she closed her eyes to allow it full sway.</p>

<p class='c011'>They waited, mute, until she should again look at
them. When she did, new light, new life was in her face.
Here before her were these motionless ones, statues of
sweet solicitude. In answering their gaze, she thought
only of them, for the moment. Thus joyous was her
tone. “Sir Deucalion, thou wert right. Much is there
yet to live for. My life cannot be void, barren. It hath
its bright, its fertile spots. I see them. They cheer me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She held out her hand to him. On his knees, he
kissed it, the others, thereupon, emulating him: then, at
his sign, the young people turned to withdraw with him.
And Atlana and Pyrrha were left together.</p>

<p class='c011'>Not many days after, Queen Atlana was able to show
herself to her Atlanteans, the while allowing the delighted
Azu to bear her train. Rapturously was she greeted, so
that she wept for joy. In these tears had gladness no
place. For, gladness comes of the body, joy of the
spirit. The queen’s spirit was moved to its depths, for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>ever, as now, had the Atlanteans shown her love and
fealty. Never had they been lacking. Always might
she be sure of them.</p>

<p class='c011'>Well did Deucalion speak her words. Her Atlanteans
with her were to weep no more, with her were to hope,
with her were to begin a new life in the country of their
refuge, Pelasgia.</p>

<p class='c011'>To which were returned assurances the most comforting.
For, like herself, her subjects were trying to look
upon the side least dark. Thus they declared their homage:
that they would rally about her with no fear and
all zeal, and make a new Atlantis for her and themselves.</p>

<p class='c011'>She, standing stately, signified her satisfaction. And,
thereafter, retired to weep her last, and find the beginning

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XX.<br /> <span class='large'>HAPPY PAIRS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Meanwhile, the young people had been reveling in
their happiness, and this bright, smooth sailing over the
Middle Sea. The hours were winged. As well were
they winged to Pelop and Peloppa, whose eyes found
constant entertainment, whose tongues, continual employment.
Even Pyrrha and Deucalion were as fruitful a
source of interest as the young lovers. Thus, Pelop
and Peloppa were ever finding means to get upon their
vessel that they might watch the tender emotions so
prevalent.</p>

<p class='c011'>One soft, breezeless, starlit evening, the friends met together
on Pyrrha’s vessel. Of course, conversation was
not long in reaching its accustomed height; when, in the
midst of the noise, Hellen, who had been standing at the
stern, came beside Electra.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Electra, it is the night for a ride. Let us get in the
boat. It tempteth as it followeth in such ease.”</p>

<p class='c011'>For the fantastic boat had been attached to the vessel;
and it was Deucalion and Pyrrha’s habit to sit in it of
mornings, and be pulled slowly or swiftly, as the vessel
pleased.</p>

<p class='c011'>Hellen’s tone, though subdued, was most eager. Thus,
Electra, who had never been in the boat, and who longed
for the ride, answered fitly, “Yea.” And at once arose
and walked off with him.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>When they were at the stern, and looking over, Pelop,
who had apparently been all intent upon some remark of
Ephes, turned and confided:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, Peloppa, but that young Hellen is a wary one!
Didst thou note him? Well can I see what he meaneth.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Peloppa, who had been no less interested, returned, “I
have lost naught. And how quick is she to further
him. What haste was in her gait, what hope was in her
eye. Is that Atlantean modesty?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She hath no thought of his meaning.” Pelop’s tone
was indignant. “If she had thought of it, she would
have looked wise, and said ‘Nay,’ however much against
her will. As if I know not young women!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is thou dost flatter thyself thou knowest them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou canst not deny I have had my trials.” Here he
coughed and winked in his waggish way, so that Peloppa
laughed, as she retorted:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of a truth, thy trials have been sore—if thou meanest
me. Ah, to think I was once young, Pelop. And what
a race I led thee. There was no such willing way as
this, though I felt but the more willing within.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is why I boast of my trials. When thou saidst
‘Nay,’ and ran away, I read thee, and laughed. But
caught thee soon.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Forsake not the truth, Pelop. And—young was I.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of a truth, wert thou young. And art young still.
Therefore, in thy youth of body and mirth of spirit, go
not beyond the bounds of kind thought. I speak of
Electra.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou hast the right, as ever, Pelop. I fear I have
judged in haste. But, as thou knowest so well young
women, thou shouldst have knowledge, also, of riper ones.
We love to set up our sex in judgment.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>“And yet, after judging, are but the more ready to forgive,”
was the gallant answer.</p>

<p class='c011'>Pelop, honor to him, was right. In all innocence had
Electra gone with Hellen. So, when he had descended
the ladder, brought the boat well under it, and attached
it, she was ready to follow him; and did. When at the
bottom, she turned, and held out her hand to make the
spring. Hellen, as he stood firmly in the boat, spoke in
calmest of tones: “Jump, Electra.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She obeyed, holding out both hands to him. But ignoring
the hands, he caught herself, to hug her close
and with the strength of his eager young love as he drew
her down to a seat. Rapturous was his whisper, “Now
have I thee to myself, Electra!”</p>

<p class='c011'>It must be confessed that, for the moment, Electra was
helpless from delight. But, womanlike, in the next, she
rallied to say and do that which was most foreign to her
inclination. For all the times were so ancient, she remonstrated
with the usual dignified manner of to-day.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Shame, Hellen! Let me go. Thou dost forget thyself!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Forget myself, Electra! At last am I acting my true
self. At last am I doing what I have longed for day and
night, at last I clasp thee!” Here he hugged her even
harder. “And thus clasping thee, could I die, did I think
thou wouldst not look upon me. For beyond words art
thou dear—as thou shouldst know. Now, wilt thou be
my wife?”</p>

<p class='c011'>This suddenness was overwhelming. But such was
Hellen. As she struggled to free herself, she spoke with
fine reason. “For thee to talk of wedding! Thou art
too young. As am I. Let me go.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>“Never—until thou answerest.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Give me but breath to answer.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Make not merry. Come, let me see thine eyes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Hard he tried to turn her head; but she was strong,
firm. There, under the starlight, with the noise of the
talking above, and to the purling of the water against the
neighboring vessels, they both persisted, he in holding
her, and she in trying to get away. Pathetically, he continued:</p>

<p class='c011'>“As thou sayest, Electra, we are young in years, but
thou canst not add we are young in sorrowing. We are
ages old in that we have borne!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Too much was this for Electra. The dreadful past at
once swept over her. She thought of that time when
she had first beheld Hellen in the temple; of the swift
outgoing of her sympathy, aye, love; of those meetings
in which she had come to know of his independence,
his impetuosity, his agonies. Then her eyes suffusing,
she turned to look at him—looked to perceive the old
anxiety reappearing, for again was he doubting, fearing.
And this decided her. No more suffering should be his
through her. Instantly, her struggling ceased. Then
her arms got about him to fond murmuring,</p>

<p class='c011'>“As if ever I could forget aught that thou hast borne.
Hellen—dear Hellen!”</p>

<p class='c011'>His was then the distraction of joy. In a mad way did
he embrace her, the while whispering vehemently, “Electra,
as soon as we set foot in Pelasgia, will we wed.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Intent upon soothing him, she answered, “Yea, yea,
Hellen, we will. But I beg thee to be calm. I worry
for thee.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He held her close, not speaking. She subjoined in a
faint tone, for the pressure was trying,</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>“Hellen, I beg, let us behave.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Callest thou not this behaving?” he entreated.</p>

<p class='c011'>She had to laugh; and this so impaired the small quantity
of breath remaining that he was obliged to hold her
more at arm’s length. And well was it that he did. For
scarcely were his arms removed than a voice was heard
above. In the next instant, Deucalion was looking over
at them, and marveling at the staid manner in which
they were comporting themselves.</p>

<p class='c011'>“How is it with you?” he inquired dryly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Never as well, Father! Come down.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think not.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But I beg thee, Father. We have somewhat to tell
thee.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Can it not wait?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not many moments. Come—come!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Therefore, Deucalion descended. When he was well
steadied in the boat, Hellen said, with due caution,
“Father—but now—have I asked Electra to be my wife.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Hellen had thought to overwhelm his father. But
nothing of the kind, for Deucalion only looked from one
to the other with provoking coolness. “So I judged.
I knew why thou didst wish Electra to come down here.
We all did.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Father!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thinkest thou we are blind? Hath it not long been
clear that thyself and Electra would come to this? It is
nature, and cannot be hid.—Come, Electra, look at me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Electra, after several invitations, complied; but her
eyes were shifting, and her color high. Deucalion, that
he might reassure her, said, with much affection, “Electra,
after Æole, no one could be so dear a daughter as thou.
Of this, thou shouldst be sure.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>She murmured, “Yea, yea, I know it.” Then with
more strength, added, “And where could I find such a
father?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know thy mind. We are both pleased. So now
to tell those above. Now to delight Pelop and Peloppa
after thy mother.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What meanest thou, Father?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is that Pelop and Peloppa, after thy mother and
myself, have looked with strong favor upon thy heart for
each other.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Great was the astonishment of the two. “But—how
knew they it, Father?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Call to mind that thyself and Electra have been so
bent upon this as to be without eyes for others.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“True—true!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thus was I. Thy mother caused me to think of
naught but herself.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then canst thou feel for us. For, will not I feel with
my children when they come to this? Ah, but they will
find in me the feeling they crave, that sweet knowledge
they will believe none have known but themselves. Yea,
this my delight, will live again in theirs. Its memory,
even, will be delight. Thinkest thou not with me, Electra?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Scarcely could Electra reply to so much. But Deucalion
spoke for her. “Hellen, leave that which may
happen in the coming years to itself. Come back to the
present. There art thou on safe ground. There can
Electra answer thee. And that she may answer, I will
leave you together, while I go to tell those above.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is it, Father. After some little time, will we
follow thee.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>“Take thy time—take thy time. Life is too short to
be in a hurry.” With these last wise words, and a
merry twinkling of the eyes toward the blushing Electra,
he turned to ascend the ladder.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the bliss of being left to themselves was like all
bliss in general. It did not last long. Scarce seemed it
a minute when Pyrrha’s voice was heard calling to them.
Thus warned, they sat up properly to await the moment
when her dear eyes should be looking down upon them.
Then it was, “Come, come, my children. Come, that I
may clasp you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, Mother, if thou wouldst but wait a little. I
have but just begun!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hellen!” reprimanded Electra; and so comically that
Deucalion, who was peering over, burst into a laugh.
This brought all the friends about him to peer over also.
Foremost was Pelop. Upon catching his roguish look,
Hellen was forced to laugh himself, though he said thereafter,
lugubriously: “Electra, up will we go. No peace
is our own for this night, I know.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So, up they hastened to be caressed and congratulated
in Pyrrha’s sweetest fashion, and then set upon by the
friends and the rather pensive Sensel. As to Æole, she
was in such a flutter of sympathy and delight that her
lips refused duty, though her eyes answered for both:
and her blushes almost equaled Electra’s.</p>

<p class='c011'>High ran the enthusiasm. Then succeeded the usual
calm. So it was that the plighted ones fell to regarding
each other in surprise. It seemed as though months had
passed, so much at home did they feel in this new condition.
Upon parting for the night, Electra whispered:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of a truth, Hellen, it seemeth an age since we left the
boat.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>The world was now of a rare brightness to these lovers,
and this increased in quality, if possible, with the days.
Sensel, beholding, rejoiced; and yet pined with envy.
Why could not he become thus positive as regarded
Æole? It was sinful further to fritter away the precious
time! He, like Hellen, must make opportunity. But
how? The boat was an old story. What could he devise
instead?</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus he fell to planning, as his eyes followed wistfully
the happy pair that were ever moving about together.
He and Æole might be as they. Yet were the precious
hours wasting.</p>

<p class='c011'>Not that Sensel was always following with his eyes
this couple. No, it was only at such times as Æole was
not in sight; otherwise his absorption was in her, and was
ecstatic. For with the happiness that had come about
her, she had grown even lovelier; and further, seemed to
tread the air. Besides, several times had Sensel surprised
her regarding intently himself when he had
turned back to look upon her—and to her evident discomfiture.
For it must be admitted that, at such times,
she was deep in thought to some such effect:</p>

<p class='c011'>“What a noble beauty covereth the good in Sensel!
What an air, what a movement is his! He walketh not—he
soareth! Never was there such grace, such a tread
in man before. It is no wonder he could so well take
his strange part. And, can I ever cease to think upon
him as Sensel? Hard is it ever to bring to mind that he
is Prince Pelasgus, harder to call him that. Ever will
he be to me Sensel—dear Sensel. And to think that his
was the voice!”</p>

<p class='c011'>But Sensel would have been no true, ardent lover had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>he not managed a way to press his suit. His first move
was to confess his love to Deucalion, and his desire to
speak with Æole. Whereupon, Deucalion replied to the
effect that he knew this was coming, and was in sympathy,
but that he could not give consent without that of King
Pelasgus as he might have other views. However, his
scruples were removed when the prince assured him it
had ever been the advice of his father and mother that
he should wed for love, and seek love. He was to scorn
all thought of worldly advantage. Thus, there could be
no bar to consent. His parents would think with him,
especially as his love was the daughter of the man most
revered in Pelasgia. At the end, he entreated:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dear Deucalion, in this manner I ask thy help. On
the morrow, in the morning, let there be no company.
Then give Hellen the word. And afterward, go with
Pyrrha to visit Queen Atlana. Thus will open the way.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Prince Pelasgus, it shall be as thou sayest.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou dost not speak with cheer, Deucalion.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“For reason, dear Prince. It is no light matter to find
that children are going from one, are eager to make nests
for themselves, that they pine not to leave the home tree.
Yet, how much more is the weight when these children
have been gone weary, cruel years; and make naught of
those years in the strength of new, fond feeling.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Deucalion, were I the father, I should feel as thou.
Yet, there is much that is bright. For, though Æole
and Hellen go from thyself and Pyrrha, their sweetest
hopes have full being. Happy art thou in that!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is well said. But it cometh hard. When thine
own go from thee, thou wilt the better know.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“May it come to that, dear Deucalion!” He spoke in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>high glee. “May it come to that—that Æole and I may
live to see our children go from us in this way. Then
will I think of this and speed them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou art of a kind with Peloppa,” laughed Deucalion.
And then laughed the prince. For, well had both
listened to Friend Pelop: only with this difference that
the latter had listened to what concerned Hellen and
Electra alone.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is great praise to be thus likened, Deucalion.
Peloppa is a dear, kind soul. Often have I wanted to
listen to her when she hath taken Pelop to one side.
Well I know what are her thoughts upon the giving up
of children. Well I know what would be her words of
cheer did she dream of my hope for Æole. There would
I get feeling for feeling!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Did she dream of thy hope for Æole? Thinkest
thou her eyes have been open but for the other pair?
Many times hath Pelop come to whisper what she hath
noted, and how warm is her heart for thee. Well is
everything for you two settled in her busy mind!”</p>

<p class='c011'>This left Prince Pelasgus without words. As he stood
thus routed, Deucalion, smiling roguishly, turned away.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dear Prince, I will leave thee to think upon it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>As to the visiting, it had been well kept up in these
day of calm sailing. For, as the vessels stood at no
great height above the water, it was easy to get from one
to the other, especially as certain ingenious ladders had
been made by the sailors. But, if the visiting went on
briskly, even more briskly moved the Pelasgian tongues.</p>

<p class='c011'>The next morning, Deucalion spoke with Hellen; and
then took Pyrrha over to the queen. Thus the four
young people were left to themselves in the cabin, Æole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>and Electra being busied in needlework, and Sensel and
Hellen interested in watching them.</p>

<p class='c011'>But they had not long enjoyed this when Hellen, with
abruptness, spoke fast, “Electra, it cometh to me that I
would see the captain. Wilt thou come?”</p>

<p class='c011'>She at once arose, the while apologizing, “Æole, we
will come back ere a little.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then out they hastened. And Sensel arose as if to
look after them. But, chancing to turn before he reached
the door, he again met Æole’s eloquent look.</p>

<p class='c011'>He went toward her. “What is it, Æole?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Though somewhat confused, she answered calmly,
“Sensel—Prince Pelasgus—I was wondering at thy manner
of moving. Whence is it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>He sat down beside her. “Æole, as a child, I was
strong and quick. As a youth, I was first in the games.
It is a gift.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well didst thou bear thy part. After that, I shall
ever feel kind to their serpent selves. And, that well-streaked
garment of dust, where is it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is laid away, ever to be kept.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is good. But thine eyes, they puzzle me. Though
they shine now, they shone even more then. They knew
how to pierce. And thy skin was less fair.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was but a little coloring for both.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How often do Electra and I talk of thy kind deeds to
us. Thou wert ever ready, never weary.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Was it not delight to serve thee and her?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But—the priests. Strange it seemed that they should
look so much to thee.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I was quick. They were sluggish—as were the serving
men.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>“Though Electra and myself were firm in the thought
that thou wert our friend—yet there was every reason
for believing thee the helper of the king and high priest.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wonder that they so soon looked to me. But thy
father willed it. Thou knowest his power.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And thy mastery of the Atlantean tongue. Well
was it ye were able to speak it before we were called to
the temple.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Couldst thou have seen thy father and myself at our
study when the noise and mirth of the temple were over
for the night!”</p>

<p class='c011'>She shivered at the words <i>noise and mirth</i>. Then said
low, “Often have I wanted to ask thee why thou didst
watch us from behind that thicket.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I was there at wish of thy father. He feared Atlano
might send spies upon you. Further, I wished to speak
with Hellen.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Were there spies?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Twice, far off, I saw figures; but, as I bounded toward
them, they fled.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What a mercy! And what good did thy words do
Hellen. Dear Hellen, what he hath borne! But he forgetteth,
now that he is thus happy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He looked at her intently. “Æole, hast thou ever
witnessed any as happy as himself and Electra?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Never have I been with two that have promised to
wed. But there are my mother and father, Pelop and
Peloppa.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mighty is such feeling; and mightiest, if answered.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Æole, affected at his tone, looked at him to find that
he was gazing at her very strangely. If ever eyes were
full of love, his were. And he was seizing her hand.
The moment had come. Oh, for time to speak!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>“Æole, thou must know why I spoke thus of Hellen
and Electra. They are one pair. There should be another.
We should be as they. Tell me that thou carest
for me. For ever since I first beheld thee in the temple
hath my heart gone out to thee. Only thou canst be my
wife!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Her hands were pressed hard in his, her little hands,
that, like her whole body, were trembling; and her face
had become as a lily. Scarcely could she support herself.
Perceiving this, he relinquished the hands, and put his
arms about her.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Æole, rallying, entreated, “Prince Pelasgus, I ask
that thou wilt take away thine arms. Thou hast not had
leave to place them thus. And hearken, I beseech thee.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He withdrew his arms. “To good words will I hearken.
Can aught else come from thee? Say but the <i>yea</i>, first,
dear Æole. Then will I hearken the day long!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“As if thou hadst not spoken words that bring me
joy—in speaking as thou hast, in asking me for thy wife—words
that would bring <i>yea</i> but for this.” Here she
was obliged to repress his ardor, and with difficulty.
“Thy father is the king. His will thou shouldst know
I ask thee to wait until thou hast spoken with him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Afterward will I speak with him. Where is thy yea?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Think—thou art the son of the king.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do think of it. And now am I most honoring him!
Ever hath my father said I should be free in my choice,
his own happy life so bearing upon him. Further, such
is the custom of the Pelasgians, high and low. They
wed as did the people of the Golden Age. There is
tender thought before all else. It is such thought in
wedlock that causeth their sun to shine on happy days,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>their moon and stars to light sweet nights of rest. Ah,
our Pelasgia is the land of lands! And Heaven, after
Atlantis!—But, thou tremblest, Æole. Wrong am I to
name that island. Rather will I speak of the feeling my
father hath for thine. None doth he honor as Deucalion!
Then is thy doubt gone. There is no other?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Prince Pelasgus, that was my one doubt.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He drew her to him, and neither spoke for a little. Then
he said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Æole, I went to Atlantis, out of the feeling I bore thy
father. Little thought I that it could hold the one of all
the world for me! But, at the moment of first beholding
thee, there was such a springing up of strong, fond wish
for thee that I became stricken with fear that such might
be for naught, that thou wouldst feel for me but pity,
because of my looks and state. Ah, what I bore! Tell
me, dear Æole, that thou didst not feel thus.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sensel, from the first was I drawn to thee, and often
did I wonder over my feelings. But when thou didst
bear me from the temple to the chariot of the queen, then
I knew—knew how dear wert thou. And how hath it
grown. Should we be parted, life would be more than
an Atlantis of sorrow!”</p>

<p class='c011'>His beautiful eyes moistened. He whispered, “It hath
come, it hath come!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Long they communed before Æole bethought her of
the two that had gone off to speak with the captain.
“Where can they be?” she exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hellen and Electra. Never have I thought of them!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is with thought they are staying away.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What meanest thou?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>“When Hellen took off Electra, he meant not to come
back. Without doubt, he hath made it known to her;
and she, of her feeling, hath asked that they visit the
queen.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What hath he made known to her?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That I wished to be alone with thee.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Didst thou speak thus to Hellen?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nay; but thy father did.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My father!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yea; thy father.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why should my father do thus?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Because I told him my wish. Because I asked him
to go away with thy mother, and bid Hellen take off
Electra. Thus could I have thee alone.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wouldst thou tell me this is a plot?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Call it what thou wilt, dear Æole. If plot, it is my
plot. And full as good is it as the way Hellen took.
Yea, even better, for look how long I have had thee to
myself in this the beginning of our bliss.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sensel!” More than volumes was in her tone as she
arose.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Æole, much doth that air become thee. Have a
care!”</p>

<p class='c011'>She looked down upon him in rebuke, and full of enjoyment
was he over her dignity.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Prince Pelasgus, thou didst plot with my father!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I did, Æole. Firm was I to have thee to myself, for
I was wild for this thy sweet word. And now have I it!
As to thy father, ah the delight of his feeling for me, and
better, his furthering! Moreover, there is the feeling, the
furthering of Hellen. Did he not hasten off with Electra?
Thus hath it come to pass. Thus have I thy word to be
mine forever!”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>He also had arisen.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And thou thinkest I can bear to be plotted about?
I have the thought to take back my word. It hath gone
too soon. Yea, I will have it again. Sensel, give it to
me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Atlantis will rise ere I yield it! Ah, but I should
like well to have thee take it back, though.” He had
now caught her to him. “Yea, dear Æole, much should
I like thee to take it back—for only with me will it go!”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXI.<br /> <span class='large'>IN PELASGIA.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Fast were they nearing the dear Pelasgian coast. And
jubilant became those returning. Hardly seemed it reality
when they began to thread the islands off-lying their
land. But the exuberance of feeling was hidden because
of the sad-eyed Atlanteans, whose vessels followed dispiritedly.
Thus, the Pelasgians hugged their joy to
themselves. Never had the sky been a blue so deep,
never the water so calm and tender, never the islands so
enchanting, never the breezes so odorous. For home
was near.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the morning before entering harbor, this happened.</p>

<p class='c011'>Deucalion called Pyrrha to their small sleeping room,
and when none could hear, said: “Pyrrha, thou knowest
that, since a little before the sinking of Atlantis, my strange
sight hath failed me. Thus, I thought it had gone from
me. But, a few minutes since, whilst sitting here thinking
upon our present happy state, again I saw clearly.” He
paused, overcome.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Deucalion, what is it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pyrrha, I saw our harbor lying waste, as though
many waters had rushed upon it. Naught was left.
Houses, vessels, landings—all were gone. In a flash it
passed before me. But, ah how plain! Pyrrha, our
harbor is a ruin. The floods have swept it!”</p>

<p class='c011'>She was stricken with fear. “Deucalion, never hath
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>that strange inner sight failed thee. What thou didst
behold in that moment, <i>is</i>!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pyrrha, I was not thinking of home. I was dwelling
upon our life on this vessel—when it came upon me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is a strange, a dread power. Thinkest thou it
cometh of some fine, airy force of the spirit?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It may. But what is that force?”</p>

<p class='c011'>She mused a little to brighten and say confidently,
“Could it be that—that—for the moment—thy spirit
leaveth its shell—and, as in a flash—traveleth far—and
back? That, in this, is thine inner sight?”</p>

<p class='c011'>He was surprised. “Pyrrha, thou mayest have it. I
have wondered much if the sight of my body dulled before
the sight of the spirit. It is in my mind that the
cares of the body hamper the spirit; but, if such cares
become as naught, the spirit hath full power, and then are
the inner sight and hearing opened. Again, I have questioned
whether this strange sight cometh not of some
hidden force of matter. Ah, it doth confound me!—For,
all things are as air before it. They stand not in the
way, however far the seeing.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yea—yea—either the spirit flasheth out and back, or
the sight of the body giveth way to this second sight,
this seeing of the spirit. When at war, how often did I
see thee. When our children were in Atlantis, how
often were they before me. And, when I was in Atlantis,
how often I saw thee, until a little ere I left. Then did
this inner sight fail me. Thus became I worried over
thee—to fall into doubt. Why could I not see thee then?
Nor afterward?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thy spirit was so torn with the evils about thee, the
dangers besetting the children, the risk in setting them
free, that it could not become calm enough to see.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>“That is it. Though, through all was I sure that I
would master. Yet, the dread.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou art but man. Therefore must hope join
hands with dread, at times. But tell me, why, if the
children were so much before thee when in Atlantis,
didst thou not know of the Pelasgian speech of the
queen?” She smiled through her tears, hoping to tease
him a little.</p>

<p class='c011'>But he was ready. “Smile, if thou wilt, Pyrrha.
Then will I. It was not every day that I could see them;
but only on those days when Atlantean was spoken.
Thou wilt call to mind that thou didst tell me the talk
of one day was in Atlantean, the next in Pelasgian.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, but thou hast the last! As I might have
known. Never art thou at a loss!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not whilst thou art of earth, Pyrrha. All is gain,
cheer, with thee beside me. And now wilt thou do thy
best. For my heart faileth.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yet here am I jesting, smiling.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is well. But, ah, the vision! How plain was it.
Thus are we warned. But woe to Prince Pelasgus!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“His father is not of earth. He is with his wife above.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Deucalion!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yea, yea, I feel it. Call to mind that I felt the ruin
that was to come upon Atlantis: and, that with all, I
should save our children. Call to mind that I felt their
state in Atlantis even before my inner sight showed such.
Think how often I saw them afterward when under the
care of the queen. Did not I picture the queen? Did
not I tell thee of their daily life?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou didst—thou didst!”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>“And—I felt—even before I saw.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I call it to mind.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“So now I feel this about the king and queen.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wilt thou tell the prince?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, Pyrrha—he is so happy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wouldst thou have me tell him?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We will wait, and think upon it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The two, dejected, sat down to ponder. After a little,
Deucalion concluded, “Pyrrha, this night will I speak
with him. Let him spend one more day of joy. Before
he seeketh his couch will I warn him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know thou wilt cheer him. Ah, what misery
is ever ready to swoop upon us of earth! Here are these
poor Atlanteans with grief sorely checking their pulses,
beginning to rouse a little. Their sluggish hearts are
quickening. And to what? To further misery, further
death of hope. Ah, our own misery will be as naught
beside theirs!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“True—true. It doth confound me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Too soon came the night. When all had parted for
rest, the unhappy Deucalion led the prince aside that he
might relate the vision. The latter, though greatly
shaken, could not bring himself to accept it, but again
and again insisted:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Deucalion, thou art wrong. For once, mayst thou
be wrong. I cannot believe. Our dear harbor, the vessels
that have done such service, the homes, the lives!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Deucalion was agonized; and his pallor was extreme.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Deucalion, be not thus wrought. Let mine be the
sorrow. Enough hast thou borne.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It may be that I should not have told thee.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou hast my thanks. Should the worst come, I am
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>ready. Shouldst thou be wrong, should our harbor welcome
us in its pride, there is the more cause for joy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Deucalion looked upon him piteously; then taking his
hand kissed it. “Dear Prince,” he wept, “Dear Prince!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou hast more to tell, Deucalion? My father, my
mother—is it well with them?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dear Prince, it is well with them—too well.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Too well?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I fear it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou hast seen?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nay, I have but felt.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah—I know what that meaneth!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The words came in gasps. He turned aside, forlorn.
But Deucalion, seizing his hands, besought. “May I be
wrong—may I be wrong!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The prince shook his head. A deathly paleness was
upon him, and he began to totter. Deucalion, as he sustained
him, implored him not to be overcome; and led
him to a couch. Here he remained as if in stupor; but,
erelong, stood up, himself, calm and resolute.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Deucalion, I will look for the worst. But will beseech
thou mayst be wrong.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then, under the stars, the two walked and whispered
through the dreary night.</p>

<p class='c011'>Early the next morning, they drew nigh the harbor.
Almost was the moment at hand when the dear port in
its tranquillity and beauty would gladden their eyes.
Eagerly did the strangers, as well as the returning ones,
await the first glimpse of this lauded haven.</p>

<p class='c011'>And it came.</p>

<p class='c011'>They looked to see—the peaceful bay, the busy landings,
the speeding or quiescent vessels, the houses, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>hurrying figures of the port, the glory of the distant
hills?—</p>

<p class='c011'>Alas, they saw them not!</p>

<p class='c011'>What was this? In mistake had they entered some
unknown bay that had been scourged by the furious elements?
Yon hills were blasted. This was not their
tranquil harbor, their happy port! Where were the vessels,
the houses, the active figures, the smiling hills?
This place was a nightmare!</p>

<p class='c011'>Almost frenzied, strangers and returning ones looked
about them—all save Deucalion and Prince Pelasgus who
stood frozen.</p>

<p class='c011'>But—on went the vessels—the fact growing upon the
horrified beholders that some mighty rush of waters
must have swept the place—this harbor they had hoped
to enter, some in resignation, some in exultation. For,
trunks of trees, pieces of houses, portions of vessels,
everywhere began to impede their progress. Soon were
descried the floating remains of animals—and later, here
and there a gruesome remnant of humanity. At sight
of the first of the latter, the women fled shrieking below.
The men could but remain to gaze mute, despairing,
heartsick. And some, in derision, thought, “Is this the
haven of peace promised the stricken Atlanteans?”—It
was a mockery.</p>

<p class='c011'>But on they went, their eyes fastened on the wrecked
haven, the ruined hills, until Deucalion ordered,</p>

<p class='c011'>“We will turn yonder point.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was done. They rounded this to perceive, in a sheltered
cove, a few vessels and some apparently hastily constructed
cots on the shore. They shouted. And figures
appeared on the vessels to answer lustily. Then spoke
Prince Pelasgus:</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>“Deucalion, come with me into the boat that we may
question them. Let the vessels rest.”</p>

<p class='c011'>At the order, the vessels paused. Then Deucalion
and the prince moved off in the fantastic boat. Upon
reaching the nearest vessel, Deucalion, at behest of the
prince, called, “We would speak with the captain.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The captain proclaimed himself. Deucalion asked,
“Sir Captain, when came the flood?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sir, the flood came the full of the moon four moons
since.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was then Atlantis sank,” whispered the prince.</p>

<p class='c011'>Deucalion continued, “Sir Captain, tell us of it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sir, these vessels here lying have since come into
harbor from their voyages. This they found. Now we
wait for others, when we will build again the port. Some
of yonder vessels look Pelasgian; and thou art of us.
Tell me, when sailed thy vessels? And greeting to them,
and thee. So much will every vessel and every man
help to bring the port to itself.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The prince now spoke. “Thou wilt find us but too
glad to help. But, Sir Captain, I would question thee.
Do any of the port live?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not one liveth.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Doth the king know?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The king! Ah, the king lieth low!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What sayest thou?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The king, with some of his mighty men, was tenting
in a vale to the north of this place. There the sudden
torrents came upon them, there broke upon them the
spouts of water from the hills, there were they swept to
death!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How knowest thou?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>“Two of the mighty men who were on the mountains
above the vale hunting, and who had gone within a cave
to rest, are the sole living ones. They are ill in yon cot.
They beheld the waters rush upon the fleeing ones.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The queen?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The queen had been one week dead. They had but
come from her burial in the country above.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They are together, then,” moaned the prince. “It is
well. Ah, my father! I see thee—running—followed fast
by the cruel waters!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thy father! Thou art not the prince?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The prince threw aside his mantle. “Sir Captain Pelio
of Magnesia, thou canst but know me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The captain sank upon his knees, as did his officers
and sailors. Of their quickness, the observing ones on
the neighboring vessels did likewise. Indeed, others of
the captains were familiar with the looks of the prince.</p>

<p class='c011'>When the prince had bidden them arise, Captain Pelio
spoke out loud, and in reverence:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou art our king! We had begun to fear thou
wouldst not come back. Long mayst thou live—and in
our hearts—as did thy father!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, king it is. If it could but be ‘Sir Prince’!—But,
Sir Captain, tell me of my father.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“King Pelasgus, I would tell thee this. Think not
that thy father ran from the waters. Ah, no. From the
heights, the two mighty men beheld him meet the waters
as if in glad greeting. He tried not to fly as did the
others.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is no wonder, with my mother gone.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He was so weak and trembling, and hoarse of voice,
that Deucalion put his arm about him, and asked for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>him, “Sir Captain, where lieth the body of the king?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It lieth beside that of the queen.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Deucalion was trembling sorely, but the bowed figure
of the prince forced him to continue. “Sir Captain, as
thou seest, the prince, our king, is weak of his grief. If
I am faint, what is his state. It is best we go back to our
vessels for this day; but, on the morrow, we will see thee
and all, again. And now, for the prince, I thank thee.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The captain bowed low. Of his pity, he could not
speak.</p>

<p class='c011'>Gently did Deucalion seat the pliant prince. Then,
after waving farewell, he speeded off. Hard, hard was
it to watch the suffering in this face so dear, harder to
note the dryness of the eyes, the rocking of the body.
And no reply could he get upon speaking. In anguish
rowed Deucalion on.</p>

<p class='c011'>He reached the vessel to find Æole bending over its
side, pale, resolved; and surely she comprehended, from
her eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Father,” she said in lowest tone, “Father, I will
come down, after thou hast come up.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is well.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He ascended, and assisted her. When almost at the
bottom of the ladder, she spoke:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Help me, Sensel.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This dear voice aroused him. He stood, and held out
his arms. Into these she crept, knowing well how to
comfort him. Then she coaxed him to sit down beside
her that they might talk. With her hand in his, and no
thought for the eyes upon them, she whispered, “What
is it, Sensel?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Little by little, he related the sad story. At the end,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>she was weeping. Distressed, he begged her not to be
overcome. But the tears were as much for himself as
for the evil news, so changed was he from the happy,
ardent, brilliant Sensel who had so fondly dwelt upon his
hopes only the night before.</p>

<p class='c011'>He begged her to grow calm, whereupon she cried the
more giving this as reason, “How can I not weep when
I behold thee in such grief?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then started the tears in his own eyes; and they wept
together, to their comforting. Thus does nature afford
compensation.</p>

<p class='c011'>But shortly they were drawn from this by calls from
Queen Atlana’s galley, and looked to find Deucalion was
beckoning to them. So Prince Pelasgus began to row to
him, when near enough receiving this as explanation:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have but just brought hither, Pyrrha. And the
queen would speak with thee, dear Prince.”</p>

<p class='c011'>When aboard, the prince with Æole, hastened beneath
the awning where sat the queen and Pyrrha. Then
talked lovingly, consolingly, these two women who had
known so much of sorrow. Long, with Æole’s hand in
his, sat the prince—to watch the gruesome hills, the
floating timbers. And finally he said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Deucalion, on the morrow, will we go where my
father and mother are laid. Then for my duty to Pelasgia.”</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c011'>After King Pelasgus had knelt beside the tomb of his
parents, he repaired with Deucalion to Thessaly, which
had been undisturbed by the flood. In his beloved Larissa,
Deucalion was joyously welcomed; and the king
was hailed with loving fealty. Though, only for a little,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>could King Pelasgus tarry with Æole, as for a brief season,
he must return to the port, which was already rebuilding.</p>

<p class='c011'>Deucalion’s Thessalian compatriots would have accorded
him godlike honors upon learning of his adventures,
his successes; and hard he found it to convince
them he was but mortal. As to Pyrrha, they had always
adored her. She was their goddess, indeed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Here, in Thessaly, the ardent Hellen speedily married
Electra. Here, in Thessaly, King Pelasgus won his bride.
Here continued Queen Atlana and Pyrrha in sisterly
devotion, death parting them but a brief spell when advanced
in years, Atlana going first. Here, the polished
Atlanteans introduced their language, arts, and ancient
purity of religion—a few generations later finding the
two races merged in the cultured Hellenes, and speaking
a tongue, the Æolic, very different from either Atlantean
or Pelasgian. Indeed, this Æolic may be said to bear
the same relation to the Pelasgian that English does to
the Anglo-Saxon; and it, in turn, has colored the various
dialects of Greece since existing.</p>

<p class='c011'>Here, in Thessaly, Deucalion continued chief among
his countrymen; and finally became their king at behest
of King Pelasgus. Here to himself and Pyrrha was born
another son, the hero Amphictyon and the originator of
the famous Amphictyonic Council that so long held the
Greek tribes together in a bond surviving even their independence.
Here, Hellen succeeded his father; and from
him sprang that great race of the Hellenes that gave
Greece its ancient name of <i>Hellas</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>Here were born Hellen’s sons, Æolus, Doris, and
Xuthus; and Xuthus’ sons, Ion and Achæus. Here,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>Æolus was king after Hellen; and from here spread his
descendants over Central Greece as far as the Isthmus of
Corinth, even occupying the western coast of the Peloponnesus.
From this central region branched the great
divisions of the Hellenic race, the Dorians, the Æolians,
the Ionians, and the Achæans.</p>

<p class='c011'>King Pelasgus missed not the portion of his kingdom
given over to Deucalion—for his also, was the mighty
spiritual kingdom of love; and Æole was its queen as
well as queen of the natural kingdom. The mighty
kingdom was theirs for eternity. Over the natural, they
reigned long and well, ever furthering the progress of the
Atlantean industries.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus, the arts flourished especially in Thessaly; and
the Atlantean industries in the New Pelasgia. Whilst
commerce became supreme.</p>

<p class='c011'>And, from the union of these primeval Pelasgians and
the more cultivated Hellenes, generations afterward,
sprang a people that were the fathers of the great intellectual
Grecian race of antiquity.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Atlantis, according to the tradition of the Greek geographers,
a large island in the Atlantic Ocean to the west of the
northwest coast of Africa and the Pillars of Hercules. It was fabled
to possess a numerous population begotten by Neptune of mortal
women. The sea-kings of Atlantis were said to have invaded the
west of Europe and Africa, and to have been defeated by the Athenians
and their allies. The inhabitants finally became desperately
wicked, and the island was swept away by a deluge. Plato mentions
the island in his ‘Timæus.’ On the old Venetian maps, Atlantis

<p class='c011'><i>Atlantis.</i>—“Now, in the island of Atlantis there was a great and
wonderful empire, which had rule over the whole island, and several
others, as well as over parts of the Continent; and besides
these, they subjected the parts of Libya within the Columns of
Heracles as far as Egypt, and of Europe as far as Tyrrhenia. The
vast power thus gathered into one, endeavored to subdue at one
blow our country and yours, and the whole of the land which was
within the straits; and then, Solon, your country shone forth, in the
excellence of her virtue and strength, among all mankind; for she
was the first in courage and military skill.... And when the
rest fell off from her, she defeated and triumphed over the invaders....</p>

<p class='c011'>“But afterward there occurred violent earthquakes and floods, and
in a single day and night of rain all your warlike men in a body sank
into the earth; and the island of Atlantis in like manner disappeared,
and was sunk beneath the sea.”—Plato’s “Timæus”—<i>per</i> “Atlantis.”</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Athens.</i>—“For there was a time, Solon, before that great deluge
of all, when the city which now is Athens was first in war, and was
preëminent for the excellence of her laws, and is said to have performed
the noblest deeds, and to have had the fairest constitution
of any of which tradition tells, under the face of heaven.”—Plato’s
“Timæus,” <i>per</i> “Atlantis.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span><i>Pelasgians.</i>—“Amidst all the obscurity that hangs about the name
of the Pelasgians, it is admitted that they were the earliest known
inhabitants both of Greece and Southern Italy—at least of the Indo-Germanic
stock; for throughout Europe, as well as Asia, there appears
to have been a still earlier population. Now we are distinctly
told that the whole seaboard of Ionia and the neighboring
islands was formerly peopled by Pelasgians. They are enumerated
by Homer among the allies of the Trojans; Herodotus found
traces of them on the Propontis, and Agathias in Caria; and the
name Magnesia, which occurs twice in Lydia, as well as in Thessaly,
seems to be certainly as Pelasgic. They were found in the islands
of the Ægean from Samothrace, Imbros and Lemnos, in the
north, to Crete, in the south, as well as in the Cyclades, which form
the natural stepping-stones from Asia Minor to the Peloponnesus.
Hence, they seem to have passed from one continent to the other
both round the head of the Ægean and across its islands; and, accordingly,
the chief remnants of the race after they were overpowered
by the Hellenes, are found in Thessaly, in Epirus, in Attica,
and in the heart of Acadia. From Greece they passed over
to Southern Italy; where, perhaps, the ‘golden age of Saturn’ is
a tradition of the peaceful agricultural character which is everywhere
attributed to the Pelasgians, in contrast to the piratical habits
of the Carians and Leleges. It remains, however, a question
whether the Pelasgi were a branch of the Phrygian migration, or a
still earlier movement of the Indo-European race from their primeval
seats. The latter seems highly probable; but, at all events
the two races were very nearly akin, and it is hardly practicable to
distinguish their migrations.”—“<cite>The Ancient History of the East</cite>,”
by <i>Philip Smith, B. A.</i></p>

<p class='c011'>“The <i>Hellenes</i> and the <i>Pelasgi</i> are the two races identified with
Greece’s earliest traditions; but when we appeal to history for
their origin, or seek for the part that each has played in the majestic
drama of antiquity, there is little more than conjecture to
guide us.”—Nott and Gliddon’s “Types of Mankind,” page 103.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Deucalion and Pyrrha.</i>—“Deucalion married Pyrrha, daughter of
Epimetheus and Pandora. Zeus determined to destroy the degenerate
race of man, but Deucalion and Pyrrha, on account of their
piety, were preserved. Deucalion built a ship, in which he and
Pyrrha floated in safety, while a nine days’ flood devastated Hellas.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span><i>Hellen.</i>—“The sons of the above were Hellen and Amphictyon.
Hellen was king of Phthia in Thessaly. Amphictyon was said to
have founded the Amphictyonic of Thermopylae.”—Scull’s “Greek
Mythology Systematized.”</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Deucalion and Pyrrha.</i>—“Deucalion, king of Phthia, in Thessaly,
son of Prometheus and Clymene. According to tradition, being
forewarned by his father of an approaching deluge, he built a ship
in which he and his wife Pyrrha were saved from an inundation
which destroyed all the rest of mankind,” etc.—The American
Cyclopedia.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Hellen.</i>—“The Greeks were fond of tracing their origin back to
a common ancestor, Hellen, the son of Deucalion and Pyrrha who
were the survivors of a deluge,” etc.—Page 107, Vol. VIII, American
Cyclopedia.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Orichalcum.</i>—“That which is now only a name, and was then something
more than a name—orichalcum—was dug out of the earth in
many parts of the island, and, with the exception of gold, was esteemed
the most precious of metals among the men of those days.”—Plato.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Spiral.</i>—“A favorite design of the men of the Bronze Age in
Europe is the spiral or double spiral form.”... “We find
the same figure in an ancient fragment of pottery from the Little
Colorado.”... “The same design is also found in ancient
rock etchings of the Zunis of New Mexico.”—Ignatius Donnelly.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Handmaid.</i>—“And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah, Zilpah
his maid, for an handmaid.”—Genesis xxix: 24.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Feather Robes.</i>—The Maya nobles of ancient Yucatan wore fine
robes of feather work on all occasions.—Author.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Magnet.</i>—“The Phœnicians were familiar with the use of the
magnet. At the prow of their vessels stood the figure of a woman
(Astarte) holding a cross in one hand and pointing the way with
the other; the cross represented the compass, which was a magnetized
needle, floating in water crosswise upon a piece of reed or
wood.”—Ignatius Donnelly.</p>

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
